She reported that she had experienced\nparesthesias involving her right hand for approximately a year.\nThese have become more intense over time and have not been\nconfined to a particular region of the hand.  There does not\nseem to be any specific precipitant.  She has noticed some\naltered dexterity that she attributes to the intense\nparesthesias.  An EMG evaluation revealed only a mild ulnar\nneuropathy with conduction delay at the elbow.\n\nLast [**Month (only) **], she experienced low back pain, which she\nattributed to her yoga routine.  She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1395**]\nand was not noted to have any weakness or altered sensation or\nradicular symptoms.  The back pain improved with physical\ntherapy and no diagnostic evaluations were undertaken.\n\nMore recently, she has developed numbness and paresthesias\ninvolving the left foot.  She specifically denies any known\nweakness or bowel or bladder complaints.  She also denies\nrecalling any remote neurological symptoms.\n\nMRI of the cervical spine was performed, which revealed an\nenhancing extra-axial mass that appears to originate in the\nright antero-lateral recess of C4 that severely compresses the\nspinal cord over to the left side of the canal and is no longer\nvisible below the mid C5 vertebral body level.\n\nAs such, the patient elected to proceed with C3-C6 bilateral\nlaminectomy and decompression.\n\n",

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\n59 year old male with a past medical history of systolic\ncongestive heart failure (last EF 55-60%), atrial fibrillation\non coumadin, transaminitis secondary to cirrhosis, chronic lower\nextremity stasis dermatitis (recent admission for cellulitis on\n[**2173-6-14**]), history of pulmonary embolus and atrial thrombus who\npresented from clinic with with a significant hyponatremia,\nelevated lactate, and acute kidney injury.\n\n#. HYPONATREMIA: Etiology was likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in\nthe setting of over-aggressive diuretic use and decreased\ndietary intake of sodium.  Patient had started dieting, eating\nless salt and drinking more water.  He presented with\nhypotension and tachycardia.  Patient also presented with acute\nkidney injury, elevated lactate, fractional excretion of sodium\nless than 1, low urine sodium, and elevated creatinine and BUN\nall suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia as the etiology. While\nin the MICU his sodium was corrected with normal saline and his\nurine and serum sodium trended. Once his sodium was trending\nupward he was transferred to the medicine floor.  His torsemide\nwas held and then restarted on [**8-7**] on an every other day dosing\nschedule, and he should follow up with his PCP for repeat lab\ntesting.\n\n# HYPOTENSION / TACHYCARDIA - Though initially concerned for\nSIRS/sepsis because of leukocytosis on admission, and possible\nsource of infection being cellulitis from chronic venous stasis\nulcers.  CXR, UA, blood cultures were all negative for signs of\ninfection.  He did not have fever of systemic signs of\ninfection.  Initially he met systemic inflammatory response\nsyndrome criteria with a possible source. He was started on\nvancomycin and unasyn empirically. On re-evaluation he remained\nafebrile with no constitutional symptoms concerning for sepsis.\nHis vancomycin and unysin was discontinued and keflex was kept\non per his vascular physicians prescription. Hypotension was\nlikely a result of extracellular volume depletion in the setting\nof overdiuresis and salt restriction as above, with a reactive\ntachycardia.  Metoprolol, digoxin, and diltiazem were held for\nhypotension but restarted as his pressures tolerated them.  He\nwas monitored on telemetry and was not shown to have any atrial\nfibrillation with RVR.  However, he had asymptomatic sinus\ntachycardia to the 130-160s during physical therapy.  This was\nlikely because his home medications were held, and his\ntachycardia improved upon restarting digoxin, metoprolol, and\ndiltiazem at his home doses.  Torsemide was restarted on an\nevery other day dosing schedule.\n\n#. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Chronic issue. On coumadin, metoprolol,\ndiltizem, and digoxin at home. In the MICU, he became mildly\nhypotensive (sbp in 90s, not requiring pressors) so his\nmetoprolol and diltiazem were reduced in dose.  Upon trasnfer to\nfloor, blood pressure was stable after resuming home meidcations\nand metoprolol was uptitrates in setting of tachycardia,\nparticularly with exertion with PT. He should follow up with his\nPCP regarding titration of his rate control. His INR was\nsubtherapeutic, so his warfarin was increased to 6mg. Digoxin\nwas continued and level was not toxic.\n\n#. Acute kidney injury: Likely prerenal and related to\nhypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension. creatinine improved\nwith holding torsemide and administration of IVF. His creatine\nand BUN were trended and his creatine trended downward with IV\nfluids.\n\n#. STASIS DERMATITIS WITH POSSIBLE SUPER IMPOSED CELLULITIS:\nWhile in the MICU he did not spike a fever or appear overtly\nseptic by exam or review of systems. His leukocytosis\nnormalized. The decision was made to leave him on his outpatient\ndose of keflex however pending follow-up with his vascular\nphysician.\n\n#. CIRRHOSIS: This is a diagnosis that is currently undergoing\noutpatient workup. He did not appear hypervolemic and this was\nnot likely related to the etiology of his hyponatremia. He\ndenies alcohol abuse and is reportedly planning on undergoing a\nliver biopsy to further characterize his liver disease. His\nliver function was monitored while in the MICU and remained\nstable, and no further management of his possible cirrhosis was\nperformed.\n\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Vascular, renal, and hepatic follow-up.\n-Should f/u with PCP regarding torsemide dosing which was\ndecreased to every other day.  He should be evaluated for less\naggressive diuresis if has bump in creatinine.\n-He should follow up with his PCP and cardiology regarding\ntitration of his metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.\n-Warfarin increased to 6mg at discharge as his INR was 1.4\n\n",

Left costophrenic angle not fully included on the image.\nOtherwise, no\nfocal consolidation.\n\nEEG: report pending\n\nNEURO:\nPt was found in nursing facility nonresponsive and weak on the\nright side. Code stroke was called. Since patient had been alone\nin room, no one had witnessed seizure activity. NIHSS was 19 for\naphasia, right hemiparesis and right facial droop.\nCT code stroke protocol was performed. There was no evidence of\nacute stroke. There was suspicion that deficits were post-ictal,\nand patient actually did begin to improve within the next hour.\nHe began moving right side spontaneously, but remained aphasic\nwith poor comprehension.\nPt then spiked fever to 102 in ED. He underwent a\ntoxic/metabolic/infectious workup including CXR, complete labs,\nLP, which were unrevealing. Urine, blood and CSF cx were\nnegative.  He was treated with empiric vanco and CTX for 24\nhours.\nPt did have right maxillary sinus fluid in head CT, and had just\ncompleted a course of antibiotics for sinusitis.\nPt was admitted to neuro ICU for close monitoring.\n\nICU Course: Pt was agitated and perseverating for a prolonged\nperiod on morning of [**8-6**]. There was concern for possible\nseizure activity and he was given IV ativan 2 mg x4 doses. EEG\nwas performed which showed occasional spikes over the left\ntemporal lobe, but no status epilepticus. He was not taking oral\nmeds and was given IV Keppra overnight. On [**8-7**] he was\ntolerating PO again and was switched back to his oral AED\nregimen including Zonisamide 400 mg qhs and Trileptal 300 mg\nTID. He had ECG and cardiac enzymes done which were negative for\nacute infarction. CK was elevated, but not MB component. This\nwas considered a result of seizures and agitation causing some\nmuscle breakdown, and it was trending down upon discharge.\n\nFLOOR COURSE:\nPt was at neurologic and cognitive baseline, with exam notable\nfor disorientation (knows \"hospital\", inattention) but is calm\nand cooperative with exam.\nEmpiric antibiotics were discontinued and he remained afebrile\nand leukocytosis resolved. Pt had no sinus pain or pressure,\nthus it was not considered indicated to treat the sinus findings\non CT.\nGiven 2 seizures in 24 hours, patient's dose of zonisamide was\nincreased. Given his behavoiral issues and agitation, he was\nstarted on prn seroquel.\nHe will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86384**] and [**Doctor Last Name **] in Epilepsy Center.\n\nSINUSITIS:\npt recently completed abx for sinusitis but still c/o\npain/pressure bilaterally.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\n58 year old woman with past medical history of GERD, cleared Hep\nC, Hep B, who presents with a week of mouth pain after revision\nof dental implants and swelling presumed due to oral cellulitis.\n\n\n1) Ludwig's Angina/Intraoral Cellulitis: The patient was\nevaluated in the emergency department by ENT and Oral Surgery\nwho thought no acute surgical emergency.  She never had symptoms\nof respiratory limitation or difficult with swallowing and ate\nthroughout her illness.  Imaging was without collection.\nNevertheless, given degree of swelling, reported progression,\nand failure to improve on oral regimen she was treated with\nmeropenem and admitted to the ICU for monitoring.  She was\nconverted from meropenem to\nciprofloxacin/metronidazole/vancomycin and remained stable\novernight without any hemodynamic instability or fevers.  She\nwas called out the floor and converted to amoxicillin/clavulanic\nacid.  Given history of questionable penicillin allergy (rash in\nadolescence) she was observed for 24 hours on this medication\nwith no signs of reaction.  She was discharged home to follow up\nwith her periodontist  andoral-maxillofacial surgery if desired.\n\n\n2) Severe Pain/ Anxiety: Despite stable to improving findings on\nexam patient insistent of severe pain.  She acknowledged a great\ndeal of pain and fear of pain and initially required oxycodone\nQ3hrs.  After hospitalist explained that this would make it\nimpossible for her to be discharged and after being told she\nwould need to use less she was eventually weaned down to Q6hrs\ndosing without any indication pain had worsened.  She was\nstarted on standing acetaminophen as well as gabapentin given\nlikely neuropathic component due to multiple procedures as well\nas for anxiolytic component.  This seemed helpful and she was\ndischarged with a month supply of gabapentin and a two day\nsupply of oxycodone.  PCP had planned psych referral for anxiety\nand further discussing this was encouraged of the patient.\n\n3) Allergic rhinitis: This was stable, she was continued on her\nhome fluticasone inhaler and loratidine.\n\n4) GERD: She was continued on her home omeprazole.\n\n5) Presumed COPD: Pt uses albuterol QAM for wheezing at baseline\nbut given long history of smoking seems likely this is due to\nCOPD, in which anticholinergic ipratroprium would be preferred.\nThis was started with good effect and she was discharged with a\nprescription for this medication.\n\n6) Smoking Cessation:  She expressed an interest in stopping\nsmoking but was reluctant to use nicotine patches due to fear it\nwould interfere with her implants.  She was encouraged to follow\nup with her PCP to discuss medications (i.e. buproprion) to help\nher quit.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- She will follow up with her periodontist to re-evaluate her\nmouth and assure things are healing.  She expressed a plan to\nfollow up with another oral-maxillofacial surgeon and was given\ncontact information for these services.\n\n-She will follow up with her PCP to discuss further work up and\ntreatment for COPD including likely referral to pulmonary\nclinic.\n\n\n",

Starting Monday,\nshe had been having worsening pain of her left teeth,\nanteriorly, and went to have her stiches taken out of the left\nsite. She started noticing at 7 PM that day that she was having\nworsening pain and some tongue swelling. For infections, she\nsays that she has now been on Clindamycin 300 mg TID x 10 day\ncourse for [**1-1**] courses since [**Month (only) **]. She endorses some mild\nodynophagia, but was last able to eat pizza Monday night, and\nhas been drinking coffee and eating popsicles since Tuesday. She\nis able to open her mouth, but finds it painful to do so.\nOpening her mouth causes left anterior neck pain. However, her\nsymptoms of pain centered over the posterior left mandible\nprogressing to include odynophagia and mild voice change have\nbecome worse. The swelling of her lower jaw started\napproximately 1 week ago. Her ROS is positive for weight gain\nwhich she attributes to dietary innatention. She has a L\nperioorbital headache which she has had for several weeks on an\noff, without any vision changes or blurry vision, double vision.\nHer ROS is also positive for wheezing, which she attributes to\nsmoking.  She denies any fevers.\n\nIn the ED inital vitals were 98.3 93 150/103 100%. She received\nMethylPREDNISolone Sodium Succ 125mg, Meropenem 1000 mg, and\nMorphine Sulfate 8 mg.

You did well without any of these\nacutely dangerous issues.  You were converted to a good oral\nantibiotic to continue to treat this infection as an outpatient.\n\n\nYou will continue the antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid\n(AUGMENTIN) for a total of 14 days.  You will also be taking\nchlorhexidine mouthwash.  You will also be following up with\nyour oral surgeons in the meantime to monitor your jaw and make\nsure things are healing.\n\nAside from the antibiotic you were started on a new inhaler to\nhelp what is probably longstanding damage to your lungs from\nsmoking.  This is called ipratroprium.  You have also been given\na small supply of oxycodone to help manage your pain as well as\na medicine called gabapentin that may help nerve pain from  your\nmultiple mouth procedures.  You should also take 1000 mg of\nacetaminophen (tylenol) three times a day for the next three\ndays to help with pain.  You should be cautious to avoid taking\nover the counter cold or flu remedies while taking this as these\nmedicines also contain acetaminophen.  Otherwise, continue your\nmedications as previously prescribed.\n\nWe recommend you quit smoking as this could be the biggest\nintervention you can make to improve your health.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou should schedule a follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and/or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\nearly next week to evaluate your jaw and healing.\n\nYou have been scheduled for a follow up appointment at your\nprimary care clinic to make sure you are doing well after your\nhospitalization.

On [**2129-11-3**], he had a takedown of\nabdominal wall fistulae x2, enteroenterostomy with primary small\nbowel closure, repair of multiple enterotomies, ventral hernia\nrepair with mesh inlay consisting of\nAlloDerm, and extended adhesiolysis greater than half of the\noperation. Postoperatively, he was admitted to the SICU\nintubated and on phenylephrine. He was kept sedated on propofol\nand fentanyl while intubated. On POD#1, he was extubated and\nstarted on Dilaudid PCA. On POD#4, the patient was stable to be\ntransferred to the floor, but had an episode of desaturations in\nthe 80s and was transferred back to the SICU. He was put on NRB\nwith aggressive pulmonary toilet and chest PT, after which his\nO2 sats improved. By POD#7, he was stable enough to be\ntransferred to the floor.\n\n",

Multiple operations were undertaken\nafter that to try and repair this and ultimately the patient was\ntransferred to my care with an enterocutaneous fistula. We\ntemporized him and improved his nutrition and after that was\nstabilized after a couple of months here in our hospital, he was\nsent to a local rehab hospital for further conditioning. The\nplan would be to take down his fistula in greater than 6 months\nfrom the time of the original\noperation.\n\n\n",

There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\nleaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the\naortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral\nvalve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral\nvalve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There\nis no pericardial effusion.\n\nImpression: No echocardiographic signs of endocarditis. Normal\nbiventricular function, no significant valvular pathology.\n\n\nNeuro: While on the floor, the patient was on Dilaudid PCA with\ngood effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral\nintake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.\n\nCV: Postoperatively, the patient was kept on metoprolol for rate\ncontrol given his atrial fibrillation. During his hospital stay,\nhe had occasional runs of asymptomatic V-tach and was monitored\non telemetry. He was otherwise stable from a cardiovascular\nstandpoint;vital signs were routinely monitored.\n\nPulmonary: While on the floor, he was stable from a pulmonary\nstandpoint;vital signs were routinely monitored.\n\nGI: Postoperatively, the patient's abdomen (fascia closed,\nsubcutaneous layer open) was covered with wet-to-dry dressings.\nOn POD#4, an abdominal wound vac was placed with a binder. Wound\nvac changes were done every 3-4 days.\n\nFEN/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was started on TPN. He was\nalso given IV fluids until tolerating oral intake. His diet was\nadvanced when appropriate, which was tolerated well. He was also\nstarted on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley\nwas removed on POD#9. Intake and output were closely monitored.\n\nID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV\nVanc/Cipro/Flagyl. POD#4 blood cultures revealed Enterococcus\nfaecalis that was sensitive to vanc. On POD#7, Flagyl was d/c'd.\nOn POD#11, Flagyl was d/c'd. On POD#13, ID was consulted for\ndischarge antibiotic coverage recommendations given his BCx.\nThey initially recommended a TEE, which was done on POD#15 and\nrevealed no vegetations.

Patient was\ninitially admitted to unit for labile BP, including hypotension.\n Patient reports recently being treated for UTI at an OSH with\nlevofloxacin and macrobid.  He was discharged home with\nmacrobid.  He endorses increasing episodes of autonomic\ndysreflexia over the past few days despite being treated for\nESBL UTI.  He presented to OSH yesterday with these symptoms,\nand was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  The\npatient had endorsed chest pain that was not [**3-7**] ACS, and had\nCTA chest that was negative for PE.\n.\nApproximately 8 months ago he began experiencing episodes of\nautonomic dysreflexia. The muscle spasms associated with these\nepisodes are extensor only and begin in his legs and move\nproximally to involve his hips, middle and upper back. Each\nextensor spasm lasts only a few seconds, is recurrent every few\nminutes, and is painful, culminating in discomfort in the left\nchest region. Associated with the spasms are: acute onset severe\nheadaches, blurred vision, mild sweating/hot feeling, and a\nfeeling of disorientation. Systolic blood pressure (taken at\nwork and at home) during these episodes is elevated to the\n170-200 range. Sitting upright helps reduce the spasms and\nsymptoms of autonomic dysreflexia.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 81 122/64 18 100, though he\nalso had an episode of hypotension in the 60s. Patient was given\nvancomycin for concern for sepsis. Dropped pressures to the\n60's.  The patient received IVF and had a clonidine patch was\nremoved. Admitted to MICU for hypotension with ? sepsis.\n.\nIn the MICU, patient continued to complain of spasms. He denied\nany dysuria, fevers, or chills. Patient reports foley catheter\nwas last changed about a week ago. His UTI was positive for P.\nAeruginosa. His antibiotics were changed from zosyn to\nmeropenem.  His foley catheter was changed.\n.\nOn the medicine floor, the patient endorses spasms.  He denies\nchest pain/SOB.  He also denies f/c.  He has no abdominal pain.\nHe is concerned about his urologic care.  He had been followed\nby a urologist until recently.  He had a scheduled urodynamic\neval that he was not able to keep [**3-7**] his recent\nhospitalization.\n\n\n",

He had thrived since then but\nrecently was admitted last month for pruritus, pain, and\njaundice.  He also had sepsis at that point.  An ERCP was\nattempted to analyze the bile duct, but was unsuccessful due to\nthe reroute in his gastrointestinal system.  A percutaneous\ntranshepatic cholangiogram tube was placed to drain this and\nremains in place now.  He was treated with antibiotics, and he\nstabilized out. This has been analyzed radiographically, and\nthere is an obstruction in the bile duct at the area of the\nampulla.  There is clearly a mass there, and it appears to be\ngrowing into the lumen of the duodenum.\n\n\n",

The patient was diagnosed with a resistant Pseudomonal\nUTI, and was treated for this initally with ceftazadime, and\nthen fosfomycin.  He will receive fosfomycin chronically, every\n10 days, to prevent future UTIs given that he requires a Foley\nfor urinary retention.  His 1st post-hospitalization dose of\nthis should be [**2195-8-28**].\n.\n# Diarrhea with hypokalemia: The patient's diarrhea was\nsignificant, and was initially thought to be\nantibiotic-associated.  He required significant IV repletion of\nhis potassium.  C. diff testing was negative, and a repeat stool\nculture (prior from 12d prior to admission was negative) and ova\n& parasites were no growth to date at the time of discharge.\nBecause of persistent diarrhea despite loperamide, GI was\nconsulted.  They recommended adding Lomotil, which was done, and\nhelped decrease his stool count.  On discharge he was having\nonly [**1-30**] stools a day, and his hypokalemia had stabilized, and\nrequired only oral repletion.  He should be re-evaluated for\nthis in a few weeks (see follow-up appointments) and if his\ndiarrhea has slowed (as his bowel recovers from broad spectrum\nantibiotics), his anti-diarrheals may be able to be tapered or\nstopped, and his oral potassium may be able to be stopped.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation -- continued home aspirin and metoprolol.\nHe has been deemed a poor candidate for anticoagulation given\nhis fluctuating platelet counts with CLL and high risk for fall.\n.\n# Urinary retention: Due to BPH.

However, the patient was reported to be\ntachypneic, unable to speak in full sentences, and at one point\ndesatted to 88% on RA.  He responded well to 2L of O2.\n\n\n\nPhysical exam was notable for left leg with 2+edema.  Notable\nlabs included a proBNP of 1540, Trop-T <0.01, Hct 33.5, PT 13.2,\nPTT 26.3, and INR of 1.2.  The patient also had a guaiac\nnegative stool.  Ultrasound down in the ED demonstrated deep\nvein thrombosis of the left lower extremity venous system\nextending from the calf veins (mid superficial femoral, distal\nsuperficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins) to the mid\nsuperficial femoral vein.  The patient also received a CT of the\nchest w/ and w/o contrast, and the preliminary read demonstrated\nbilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the main pulmonary\nartery at the level of the bifurcation into both the upper and\nlower pulmonary arteries bilaterally.\n\n\n\nEKG in the ED was unremarkable, and the patient received a\nheparin bolus was started on a heparin drip.

The trachea is unremarkable and the airways are\npatent to the subsegmental level.  There is no mediastinal,\naxillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Extensive coronary artery\ncalcifications are noted.  The right ventricle configuration is\nsimilar to [**2175-5-20**]. The pericardium is unremarkable witout\nthickening or effusion.  The esophagus is within normal limits\nwithout evidence of hiatal hernia.   Lung window demonstrates\nmultiple spiculated opacities.  Most prominent are spiculated\nopacities in the right apex (3:2), periphery of the right upper\nlobe (3:9), and right lower lobe (3:37).  In the left lung, the\nmost conspicuous opacities are a spiculated opacity in the\nsuperior segment of the left lower lobe (3:5).  There is no\npleural effusion or pneumothorax.\nCTA:  The aorta is well opacified and is normal in caliber\nthroughout without evidence of dissection. There are bilateral\nlobar pulmonary artery emboli.  In the right, pulmonary artery\nembolus extends from the right pulmonary artery into both the\nupper and lower lobar arteries, with almost complete occlusion\nof the upper lobar branch and extending to the subsegmental\nbranches.  In the left, there is also an embolus straddling the\nbifurcation of the left pulmonary artery extending into both the\nsuperior and inferior lobar arteries.  No definite findings to\nsuggest right heart strain.  Configuration of the right\nventricle is similar to prior.  No significant reflux of\ncontrast into IVC.\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for\nmalignancy.\nFINDINGS:  There is normal phasicity of the common femoral veins\nbilaterally.\nLEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: There is normal compression and\naugmentation of the\ncommon femoral and proximal superficial femoral.  However, the\nmid superficial femoral, distal superficial femoral, popliteal,\nand calf veins are not compressible with absent color flow,\nconsistent with thrombus extending from the calf veins to the\nmid superficial femoral veins.\nRIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: There is normal compression and\naugmentation of the common femoral, proximal superficial\nfemoral, mid superficial femoral, distal superficial femoral,\npopliteal, and calf veins.\nFINDINGS:\n\nABDOMEN:  The visualized lung bases are clear of nodules,\nconsolidations or effusions. Mild dependent change is present at\nthe lung bases bilaterally. Imaged portion of heart shows\ncoronary artery calcifications.\n\nNoncontrast evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates no new\nhepatic lesions.  The gallbladder is not distended.  Small\nhyperdense stones layer in the gallbladder neck.  The pancreas\nparenchyma is homogeneous.  The spleen is not enlarged.\nNoncontrast appearance of the kidneys within normal limits;\nincidental note is made of a cortical cleft or scar in the\ninterpolar region of the left kidney.  No ascites is present.\nThere is no evidence of intra-abdominal hematoma. Scattered\nmesenteric and periaortic retroperitoneal nodes measure up to 9\nmm in short axis (2:27) and are similar to appearence in [**2175**]. A\ncircum-aortic left renal vein was better demonstrated on prior\ncontrast CT.  There is no ascites.  The stomach, small and large\nbowel are not distended.  Hyperdense material within the gastric\nantrum and elsewhere in the bowel including a pill shaped focus\nin the right colon are likely ingested material. A small bowel\nanastomosis is noted in the right upper quadrant.\n\nPELVIS:  The rectum appears unremarkable.  Sigmoid colonic\ndiverticulosis\nnoted without inflammatory change.  Prostate enlargement is\nmild.  The bladder is unremarkable.  There is no free pelvic\nfluid or evidence of hematoma.  The psoas muscles are not\nenlarged.\n\nNo concerning lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Multiple bilateral lobar pulmonary artery emboli as\ndescribed above with extensive clot burden.  No defintie CT\nfindings of right heart strain.\n2.  Multiple spiculated pulmonary lesions are new from prior\nexam. Follow up with CT in [**3-25**] months is recommended.\n\n[**2183-7-3**] DOPPLER US OF LOWER EXTREMITIES\nIMPRESSION:  Deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity\nvenous system extending from the calf veins to the mid\nsuperficial femoral vein.\n\nECG Study Date of [**2183-7-3**]  7:11:54 PM\nSinus rhythm.

Left ventricular wall\nthickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal\n(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated\nwith focal basal free wall hypokinesis (apical sparing,\n\"[**Last Name (un) **] sign\" of acute pulmonary hypertension). The aortic\nvalve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.\nThere is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is\nno pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right ventricle with mild RV\nsystolic dysfunction. Severe pulmonary hypertension.\n\nThe severity of pulmonary hypertension suggests that a large\ncomponent of it is chronic, since an \"untrained\" right ventricle\nis unlikely to be able to generate such pressures. Consider\nbaseline pulmonary disease or prior thromboembolism.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2175-5-17**], right ventricle now appears large and\nhypokinetic. Pulmonary pressures were not previously assessed.\n\nCT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2183-7-4**] 5:22 PM\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.  No retroperitoneal hematoma or other evidence of\nintra-abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage to explain acute anemia.\n\n2.

You were admitted\nfor pain in your legs and shortness of breath and found to have\na pulmonary embolism.  We treated you on blood thinners (a pill\ncalled Warfarin, or \"Coumadin\"), which you should continue for\nlife.  You are being discharged on Lovenox shots twice a day,\nwhich you must continue until you are told to stop by your PCP\nwhen your Warfarin has reached a therapeutic blood level (INR\n[**2-21**]).  You should go to your PCP's office in 2 days for a blood\ntest.\n\nSince you had a blood clot and have a history of possible\npredisposition to clotting, as well as the fact that you seem to\nhave iron deficiency anemia despite a diagnosis of\nhemochromatosis in the past, you have been referred to\n[**Hospital **] clinic.  Please keep this appointment.\n\nNote that you also had elevated blood sugars during our stay,\nbut your diabetes medications had been held for much of the\nadmission.  Please continue these medications and follow up at\n[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes about your blood sugar (appointment listed\nbelow).\n\nFinally, because you have a history of hepatitis and liver\ndisease, you should have a screening liver ultrasound and blood\ntest (AFP).  Please discuss this with your PCP.\n\nWe made the following changes to yourFollowup Instructions:\nANTICOAGULATION\nPlease go to Dr.[**Name (NI) 16936**] office and get your blood drawn (INR\nchecked) on Wednesday [**2183-7-9**].\n\nPRIMARY CARE\nDepartment: [**Hospital1 **]\nWhen: MONDAY [**2183-7-14**] at 1:30 PM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7479**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7477**]\nBuilding: [**State 7478**] ([**Location (un) 86**], MA) [**Location (un) 551**]\nCampus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: None\n\n[**Last Name (un) **] DIABETES\n[**2183-7-30**] at 10:30AM (please be there at 10AM)\n[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19961**], NP\n\nHEMATOLOGY\nDepartment: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY\nWhen: FRIDAY [**2183-8-1**] at 9:00 AM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5056**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3062**]\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\n\n\n"

He improved and remained clinically\nstable, but stayed on the medical floor for 4 weeks awaiting\nguardianship for discharge to a rehabilitation facility.\n.\n#. Sepsis: Defined based on hypothermia and tachycardia on\nadmission, in setting of pulmonary and urinary infectious\nprocesses. Patient was initially managed on Vanco and Zosyn for\nUTI given a history of resistant pathogens, and urine eventually\ngrew out ESBL E coli. Zosyn was transitioned to Meropenem, and\npatient completed a 10 day course of Vanco and Meropenem. CXR\nshowed bilateral consolidations, which may have been due to\npneumonia or chemical pneumonitis. Sputum culture was\nunremarkable, and patient completed 10 day course of broad\nantibiotics for UTI. Patient received fluid resusication during\nhis septic physiology state, and was later diuresed to help with\nhis respiratory status (see below). After coming to the floor,\nhe was hemodynamically stable and afebrile. His blood cultures\nfrom [**Date range (1) 15128**] did not have any growth. He had no leukocytosis\nof localizing symptoms or signs of infection for the remainder\nof the hospitalization.\n.\n#. Respiratory failure: Initial CXR concerning for bilateral\npneumonia, which may have developed in setting of aspiration\nevent during seizure. Imaging also consistent with fluid\noverload from aggressive resuscitation. Sputum cultures have\nbeen negative. Patient has completed course of meropenem, and\nwas extubated successfully on [**3-15**]. Vancomycin was initially on\nboard for HCAP, but was stopped for concerns of worsening\nthrombocytopenia. Patient aggressively diuresed, and diuresis\ncontinued after extubation with IV Lasix 20 mg because CXR was\nstill consistent with edema and patient was over 8 liters\npositive for length of stay. On transfer from the ICU, patient\nwas saturating well on 3L NC. He was able to be weaned off\noxygen quickly without additional diuresis. He was maintaining\nnormal oxygen saturations on room air at time of discharge.\n.\n#. Acute Pancreatitis: Lipase 1438 on admission, and downtrended\nrapidly. He met 0/5 [**Last Name (un) **] criteria on admission. No\ncholedolcholithiasis found on ultrasound. CT abdomen without\nsigns of complications from pancreatitis. Patient was initially\nfed via postpyloric dobhoff, which was discontinued upon\ntransfer to the floor. He was transitioned to a low fat regular\ndiet, which he tolerated well.\n.\n#. Seizure disorder: Patient had presumed seizure activity in\nthe ED, and multiple seizures on 24 hour EEG monitoring. Patient\nis well known to have increased seizure activity with infection.\nIn addition, patient had recently been tapered off of Vimpat,\npossibly in error. Vimpat was restarted, and other home\nantiepileptic meds were continued. Seizure activity improved\nwith new regimen and treatment of infections as above. He was\ndischarged on  Gabapentin (1200 mg daily, 2400 mg nightly),\nOxcarbazepine (600 mg TID), Lacosamide (Vimpat) (100 mg qhs),\nand Zonisamide (300 mg daily, 400 mg nightly).\n.\n#. Urinary Tract Infection: Urine culture on [**3-3**] positive for\nESBL E. coli. Patient completed 10-day course of meropenem,\nthough repeat urine culture positive for yeast. Foley changed\nand patient started on fluconazole, as unable to assess whether\npatient symptomatic. Treated with fluconazole to complete 3 day\ncourse ([**Date range (1) 8975**]). Foley was removed and patient had successful\nvoiding trial.\n.\n#. Clostridium difficile infection: No complications of colitis\nseen on abdominal CT. Given leukocytosis, C diff. specimen was\nsent on [**3-6**] and was positive. Patient was started on PO vanco\nand IV flagyl through [**2187-3-20**]. He had resolution of symptoms but\nbegan to have increased frequency of stool on [**4-1**] with 4/5 assay\npositive for C diff. He was treated for recurrence with a 2-week\ncourse of vancomycin which he completed on [**4-18**]. He did not have\nany recurrence of symptoms, fevers, or abdominal pain and was\nhaving 1 formed stool daily at time of discharge.\n.\n#. Thrombocytopenia/Thrombocytosis: Platelet count in [**2186**] has\nranged between 60 and 600. Concern for DIC given\ninfection/pancreatitis, although coags within normal limits.\nPlatelets improved with infection treatment and even rose to\nthrombocytotic range (likely reactive in nature), which trended\ndown at time of discharge.\n.\n#. Fever: Patient had temperature of 103 rectal on [**3-18**] and was\npan-cultured. Urinalysis and culture were negative for\ninfection. [**1-2**] blood cultures (anaerobic bottle) grew\ncoagulase-negative staph, likely a skin contaminant.\nSurveillance blood cultures are pending, no growth to date. The\npatient remained afebrile and developed no other signs or\nsymptoms localizing infection. His LFTs were normal, lipase was\ntrending down, and abdominal exam benign. The exact etiology of\nhis one fever is unclear; however, he clinically appeared well\nfor 4 days after and was thought suitable for discharge. He\nremained in the hospital for several weeks awaiting guardianship\npaperwork and was afebrile for the remainder of the stay with no\nsigns/symptoms of infection (other than C diff recurrence as\nabove).\n.\n# Disposition: Evaluated by Physical Therapy and thought\nappropriate for discharge to rehabilitative center for continued\nstrength training.\n.\nTRANSITION OF CARE:\n===================\n# Patient will return to his group home after rehabilitation\nstay. He will have an appointment with his PCP scheduled after\ndischarge.\n\n",

The\npulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.\nThere is no pericardial effusion.\n.\n=========\nNeuro\n=========\nEEG [**3-4**]: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence\nof\n14 electrographic seizures characterized by a generalized\nelectrodecrement, followed by a higher amplitude rhythmic [**12-11**]\nHz activity beginning over the bifrontocentral regions with\nsecondary generalization, usually lasting between 40-50 seconds.\nThere was an extended seizure which lasted for 15 minutes\noccuring at 00:21 am. In addition, the [**6-5**] Hz theta rhythm\nbackground with bursts of generalized theta slowing is\nconsistent with a mild diffuse encephalopathy, commonly seen\nwith medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or infection. In\naddition, there were frequent interictal sharp discharges,\ngreatest over the right frontocentral region (with phase\nreversal at C4/T4), but also seen over the left frontocentral\nregion (with phase reversal at F3/C3), and rarely\nbifrontocentrally, consistent with multiple regions with\nepileptogenic potential.\n.\nEEG [**3-5**]: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence\nof 10 electrographic seizures characterized by higher amplitude\nrhythmic [**12-11**] Hz activity beginning over the bifrontocentral\nregions with secondary generalization, usually lasting between\n10-20 seconds. Compared to the previous tracing, the\nelectrographic seizures are fewer in frequency and shorter in\nduration. In addition, the [**6-5**] Hz theta rhythm background with\nbursts of generalized theta slowing is consistent with a mild\ndiffuse encephalopathy, commonly seen with medication effect,\nmetabolic disturbance, or infection. In addition, there were\nless frequent interictal sharp discharges, although still\noccasionally seen over the right frontocentral region (with\nphase reversal at C4/T4), left frontocentral region (with phase\nreversal at F3/C3), and rarely bifrontocentrally. Compared to\nthe previous tracing, there is a significant improvement in the\nfrequency of seizures and epileptiform activity.\n.\nEEG [**3-6**]: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence\nof 5 brief electrographic seizures characterized by higher\namplitude rhythmic [**12-11**] Hz activity beginning over the\nbifrontocentral regions with secondary generalization, usually\nlasting between 5-20 seconds. Compared to the previous tracing,\nthe electrographic seizures are fewer in frequency and shorter\nin duration. In addition, the [**6-5**] Hz theta rhythm background\nseen during the most awake portions of the record is consistent\nwith a mild diffuse encephalopathy, commonly seen with\nmedication effect, metabolic disturbance, or infection. In\naddition, there were occasional low amplitude interictal sharp\ndischarges, seen over the right frontocentral region (with phase\nreversal at C4/T4), left frontocentral region (with phase\nreversal at F3/C3), and rarely bifrontocentrally. Compared to\nthe previous tracing, there is a significant improvement in\nseizure frequency and background slowing.\n.\nEEG [**3-7**]: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence\nof 3 brief electrographic seizures characterized by higher\namplitude rhythmic [**12-11**] Hz activity beginning over the\nbifrontocentral regions with secondary generalization, usually\nlasting approximately 10 seconds. Compared to the previous\ntracing, the electrographic seizures are fewer in frequency and\nshorter in duration. There are also multiple brief bursts of\nsimilar appearing activity, lasting between 3-5 seconds each,\nwhich likely constitute epileptiform bursts. In addition, the\n[**6-5**] Hz theta rhythm background seen during the most awake\nportions of the record is consistent with a mild diffuse\nencephalopathy, commonly seen with medication effect, metabolic\ndisturbance, or infection. In addition, there were occasional\nlow amplitude interictal sharp discharges, seen over the right\nfrontocentral region (with phase reversal at C4/T4), left\nfrontocentral region (with phase reversal at F3/C3), and rarely\nbifrontocentrally.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 108020**] is a pleasant 83 year old male with a history of ESRD\non in-home HD who presented s/p HD with fevers and hypotension\nrequiring ICU admission:\n.\n1.  Suspected Sepsis -- Mr [**Known lastname 108020**] presented to the ED with a WBC\nof 14.5 and lactate of 2.1 in the setting of fever and\nhypotension.  Cardiac causes of hypotension were excluded with\nEKG and history, and he received 4L fluids in the ED.  A UTI was\nconsidered; his UA was suggestive but he is anuric and a urine\nculture was negative.  Given his hx of proctitis, a pelvic CT\nwas performed which did not suggest a source.  As his chronic\ndiarrhea had increased slightly in the last week, c diff toxin\nscreening was performed and was negative.\n   Given the history of symptoms beginning during dialysis and\nthe recent surgical manipulation of his AV graft site (recent\nfistulogram and dilation of stenosis 1 week PTA) a graft\ninfection was also considered.  An ultrasound performed on the\nsecond hospital day demonstrated a 2cm pseudoaneurysm of the\ngraft site with a 90% occlusive thrombus.  He received coverage\nwith vancomycin and zosyn while in the ICU, which was revised to\nvanco monotherapy upon callout to the floor.\n   He was initially maintained on neosynephrine for hypotension\nfor the first 24 hours of his ICU stay.  Importantly, his pulse\npressure is normally wide with his AV graft and pseudoaneurysm,\nand his SBPs run in the 90s-100s pre-HD and in the 80s post-HD-\nhis pressor was subsequently weaned rapidly, which was well\ntolerated.  He had no further episodes of hypotension while in\nthe hospital.\n   Infectious disease was consulted.  They felt that he\ndeveloped a transient bacteremia in the context of HD.  Culture\ndata remained negative throughout the admission.  His wife sent\na sample of his home dialysate fluid taken from the session\nprior to admission to his HD laboratory.  These were negative at\n24 and 48hrs.  No vegetations were seen on echo.  Per ID\nrecommendation, he underwent a tagged WBC scan on [**2121-11-28**], and\nwas reimaged on [**2121-11-30**].  While it demonstrated a possible\nabnormality of the right femur, he had been clinically improving\nwith resolving leukocytosis and fevers, so further imaging with\nthe recommended sulfer colloid scan was not pursued. He finished\na 7 day course of vancomycin on the day prior to discharge.  He\nwas not sent out on antibiotics.  He was given strict\ninstructions to call his physician in the event of fevers,\nchills, or rigors.\n.\n2.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Upon transfer to the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname 108020**]\ndeveloped new onset atrial fibrillation with rates to 100-110.\nThis occurred following HD, and was transient.  He was started\non 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].  His echo was not demonstrative of\nstructural etiology, and his TSH was normal.  He reverted back\ninto sinus rhythm by the following morning.  He had one other\nepisode of afib with rate 80-100 following HD the next day.  His\nmetoprolol was discontinued due to borderline BP in the 90s and\ndue to the fact that his rates were generally low while in\natrial fibrillation.  Due to his paroxysmal AFib and CHADS2\nscore of 3, he met requirement for warfarin, and was\nsubsequently heparinized and started on warfarin.  He received\n5mg x2 days with achievement of therapeutic INR of 2.9.  He will\nfollow up with his PCP to have his INR checked.\n\n3.  Diarrhea -- chronic, [**3-18**] bowel resection in past.  Rate had\nincreased in last week and he was ruled out for c diff with a\nstool toxin assay x1.\n\n4.  ESRD -- He continued to receive dialysis through his graft\nthroughout the hospitalization which was well tolerated.\n\n5.  Anemia -- Mr. [**Known lastname 108020**] has chronic anemia [**3-18**] ESRD, and is on\naranesp.  he presented with hb/hct 10.1/30.2; his hct dropped to\n26 after fluid resuscitation was was judged to be dilutional.\nHis stool was guaiac positive but he has known hemorrhoids; it\nwas not grossly bloodly.  His hct remained stable afterward.\n\n6.  Chest pain -- Mr. [**Known lastname 108020**] had a brief episode of central\nsharp chest pain after straining on HD#2.  An EKG was unchanged\nand the pain resolved without treatment.\n\n",

Today, at the onset of dialysis\nhe complained of shaking and chills; his temperature was noted\nto drop from 97.9-->94.9 and then increase to 101.8 at the end\nof HD.  He was negative 800 cc today.  He had otherwise been in\nhis usual state of health besides some overnight dizziness which\nwas attributed by the patient and his wife to newly prescribed\ngapapentin.  His HD graft includes plastic hardware and was\nplaced in 5-[**2121**].\n\nHe was discharged in [**Month (only) 205**] for proctitis and painful stooling\nwith a 14-day course of abx; his pain with defecation recurred\nrecently but has been better in last week with anal care.  His\nchronic diarrhea (he is s/p bowel resection) has been worse in\nlast week.  He denies CP, SOB, ABP, N/V, cough. He makes only\nsmall ammounts of urine; he denies tenderness over AV fistula\n\nIn the ED vitals were 101.7, 87/47, 18.  He was given 2L IVF,\nwas persistently hypotensive, received further 2L IVF and was\nstarted on pressors.  He had a tachycardic response to levophed\nand was transitioned to neosynephrine.  His mental status\nremained intact throughout.  A UA was suggestive of UTI, a CXR\nand a CT pelvis was performed.  Peripheral blood cultures were\ndrawn.\n\nHe was admitted to the MICU.\n\n\n",

You were admitted to the ICU\non medications to maintain your blood pressure, and you were\nstarted on IV antibiotics.  You remained without fevers during\nyour hospital stay.  Infectious disease doctors recommended a\nspecial study to look for a source of the infection which was\ninitially normal, though the radiologists recommended repeating\nthis test again to be sure.  This scan did not reveal any overt\nsigns of infection. The source of your infection is not\nimmediately clear- it may be related to your hemodialysis or\nyour graft.  We did an ultrasound of your graft, which did not\nreveal any infections.  We finished your antibiotics course in\nthe hospital. It is important that you call your doctor if you\ndevelop any fevers or chills concerning for infection.\n\nYou developed an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial\nfibrillation during your hospital stay.  It's source is unclear,\nbut it seems to occur following hemodialysis.  Because of an\nincreased risk of stroke, you will be starting a blood thinning\nmedication called coumadin.\n\nPlease make the following changes to yourFollowup Instructions:\nHave an appointment to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2204**] on [**Last Name (STitle) 20212**]\n[**12-3**] to go over your hospital course and monitor your blood INR\n(a measure of how thin it is)\n\nDepartment: [**State **]When: [**State **] [**2121-12-3**] at 1:20 PM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 2946**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6564**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2205**]\nBuilding: [**State **] ([**Location (un) **], MA) [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: On Street Parking\n\nDepartment: CARDIAC SERVICES\nWhen: [**Location (un) **] [**2122-2-4**] at 4:00 PM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2908**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**]\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\nDepartment: ADVANCED VASC.

Initial Cr was ~6, up from a\nbaseline of 2.2; K was 6. Acute kidney injury was thought to be\n[**3-14**] subacute process, possibly NSAID-induced as difficult to\nassess how many NSAIDs patient was taking prior to admission.\nIncreasing uremia prior to admission likely led to increased\nconfusion and fall leading to further kidney injury due to mild\nrhabdomyolysis. CK peaked at [**Numeric Identifier 2249**] started downtrending with\naggressive IVF. Renal was consulted who felt dialysis was not\nindicated as patient's urine output remained robust. Potassium\nelevation was never accompanied by EKG changes and also\ndowntrended appropriately. Patient's fenofibrate, losartan, and\ngabapentin were held in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **]. On the floor, Cr had\nimproved to 4.7 with stable BUN and lytes. Dialysis was never\nperformed. IV hydration was complicated by the patient refusing\nIV fluids.

Na peaked at 154 on [**3-19**].\n.\n# Confusion: Confusion was thought to be a consequence of toxic\nmetabolic encephalopathy (uremia, abnormal lytes, hypoglycemia,\nrenal failure) with contribution from frontal lobe contusion;\nencephalitis was thought to be less likely as the patient was\nafebrile for many days on the floor and mental status began to\nclear.

He did admit to\ntaking significant amounts of clonazepam for his back pain in\nthe weeks prior to admission - tox screen was negative on\narrival.

Symptoms were thought to be related to\nhypoglycemic episodes and worsening back pain (spinal stenosis)\nleading to possible increased  benzodiazepines. TSH and B12 were\nnormal.\n.\n#: Frontal gyrus contusion: Found on routine head CT on\nadmission to OSH. Neurosurgery was consulted upon transfer and\ncontusion was stable on repeat head imaging. No further\nintervention was recommended.\n.\n# DM: Blood sugars were managed conservatively with reduced dose\nNPH [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale insulin. The patient had no episodes\nof documented hypoglycemia during admission on the floor.\n.\n# Elevated CK: After prolonged period down. Peaked around 10,000\nand was thought not to be elevated enough to account for degree\nof kidney injury.

Post op head CT revealed\ngood evacuation. On [**2-12**] he was lethargic but EO to voice and\nhe moved all extremities. He was cleared for transfer to the\nstepdown unit. He remained stable overnight in the step down\nunit into [**2-13**]. On [**2-13**] his exam remained stable and he worked\nwith PT/OT as well. His dressing was removed and his incision\nwas clean dry and inntact with dissolvable sutures. He was\nstarted on tube feeds via NGT per nutritions recommendations. In\nthe evening his incision was noted to be swollen,warm and red\nbut he remained afebrile and there was no drainage, therefore it\nwas recommended to apply ice packs and continue to monitor. A\nfoley was replaced for urinary retention. On [**2-14**] he was\ncleared for transfer to the floor.\n\nOn [**2-15**] he was febrile and a work up was initiated.

CT\nhead was done for lethergy and this showed slight improvement in\nSDH.\n\nOn [**2132-2-17**], repeat CXR showed that the  patchy opacity at the\nright base improved.

Lower\nExtremity doppler ultrasound was negative for DVT.  CXR negative\nfor clear Pneumonia.  Blood and urine cultures were negative.\n\nHis mental status began to improve and on [**2-20**] and [**2-21**] he was\nfollowing simple commands.  Speech and Swallow evaluation was\nperformed however he was unable to consistently follow commands.\n The therapist noted delayed or prolonged oral phase and delayed\nlaryngeal elevation.  Strict NPO still recommended at this time.\nOn the evening of [**2-21**] a family meeting was held with\nNeurosurgery, Geriatrics and the HCP. It was decided at this\ntime that it would be best to transfer the patient to rehab with\nan NGTube for an additional week or so. At that time the\ndecision as to whether to place a PEG tube or not could be\nre-visited.\nOn [**2-22**] he remained stable and afebrile.

We have been\nfollowing the pt during this admission, however pt consistently\ntoo lethargic to participate and with excess secretions making\nPO\nintake unsafe.  He's had NGT placement throughout this admission\nfor nutrition, hydration, and medications.  Per chart and\ndiscussion with NeuroSurg, family is considering PEG but is\nundecided.  Geriatrics is involved and per notes are concerned\nregarding prognosis given his PMH including moderate\nAlzheimer's.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] presents today with overt s/sx of aspiration of\nthin\nliquids and concern for intermittent (possibly silent)\naspiration\nof nectar thick liquids and purees.  Pt also with documented\nupper airway congestion concerning for aspiration of oral\nsecretions.  Safest recommendation based on today's evaluation\nremains NPO with alternative means of nutrition, hydration, and\nmedication.  Videoswallow study could provide more\ndetailed/objective data, though due to pt's current mental\nstatus, not likely to participate and is, as such, not\nrecommended currently.\n\nGiven pt's premorbid functioning and poor progress in the last\nweek and a half since his Neurosurgical intervention, would\nagree\nwith MD teams that further discussion of goals of care is\nwarranted prior to pursuing PEG placement.  We are happy to\nparticipate in family meeting when one is scheduled.\n\nThis swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake\nScale (FOIS) rating of 1 out of 7.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Continue NPO\n2. Continue Q4 oral care\n3. Continue short term nutrition, hydration, and medication\n4.

Agree with [**Female First Name (un) 1634**] Fellow that\nfurther improvements in swallow function are likely to be seen\non\na period of weeks rather than days. D/c to LTACH or other\nsetting\nthat can manage NGT while awaiting further recovery seems ideal\nif possible and if within family's/pt's goals of care.  In the\ninterim, pt can be receiving PT, cognitive-linguistic therapy,\nand swallow therapy to maximize recovery.  To manage secretions\noptimally, would encourage continued Q4 oral care with\nconsideration of antibacterial [**Doctor Last Name 360**] such as Chlorhexadine, as\nis\navailable in the Sage QCare kits here at [**Hospital1 18**].  If the family\nhas further specific questions regarding swallow function after\nthe meeting this evening, please page and we'll be happy to\nspeak\nwith them tomorrow in person or by phone.\n\nUPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS\n1. NPO including no ice, no oral meds\n2. Continue Q4 oral care with Sage QCare kits, consider addition\nof Chlorhexadine\n3. Continue short term nutrition, hydration, and medication via\nNGT pending further improvements in overall medical/neurological\nstatus.\n4. Continued PT, cognitive-linguistic tx, and swallow tx here as\nable and in rehab/LTACH setting after d/c to maximize\nfunctioning.\n\n[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MS, CCC-SLP\nPager #[**Numeric Identifier 95515**]\n\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT:\nPt was offered ice chips (x2), thin liquid (tspn x3), nectar\nthick liquids (tspn x8-12), pureed solids (tspn x4-6).  Despite\nwakefulness and intermittent attentiveness, pt with limited\ninteraction with POs.  He often closes mouth against spoon,\nrequires 10-30 seconds of encouragement before opening mouth.\nMouth opening is limited.  Oral phase appeared delayed/prolonged\nwithout overt oral cavity residue.  Laryngeal elevation delayed\nand reduced to palpation.  Pt had overt cough/sputter after [**2-19**]\ntspns of thin liquid which was not observed with other\nconsistencies, however intermittent congested cough increased\nduring eval, concerning for intermittent aspiration of other\nconsistencies.  At end of eval, pt deep oropharyngeal suctioned\nvia yankauer, (+) for return of moderate amounts of puree from\nposterior oropharynx.  O2 sats stable at 94-97% throughout\nexcept\nwhen coughing on thin, at which time they dipped to 91% briefly\nand then returned.\n\nSUMMARY /Discharge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - always.\nActivity Status: Bedbound.\nLevel of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nGeneral Instructions\n\n??????\tHave a friend/family member check your incision daily for\nsigns of infection.\n??????\tTake your pain medicine as prescribed.\n??????\tExercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,\nor excessive bending.\n??????\tYou have dissolvable sutures you may wash your hair and get\nyour incision wet.\n??????\tIncrease your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain\nmedicine can cause constipation.

The\npatient' Coumadin therapy was restarted on [**7-11**] as described\nbelow. She worked closely with physical therapy as well as the\nwound ostomy team and she was stable for discharge on [**2170-7-12**].\n\n# Ulcerative Colitis: Patient was admitted for ungoing\nulcerative colitis flare despite treatment with prednisone 60 mg\npo daily and mesalamine po and suppositories. A colonoscopy\nperformed on on [**2170-5-29**] showed severe colitis and ulcerative\ncolitis flare is the most likely cause of her ongoing symptoms.\nInfectious work-up was initially negative for CMV colitis, c.\ndiff x 3, stool ova and parasites. She was treated with\nmesalamine 1600 mg po tid, mesalamine enema, hydrocorticone\nenema as well as methylprednisolone 20 mg iv q8h. She was\nmaintained on a low residue diet. Her symptoms then progressed\nand her inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) increased. Repeat c.\ndiff testing was done and came back positive. She was started on\niv metronidazole and vancomycin 500 mg po q6h. She continued to\nhave bright red blood per rectum associated with her bowel\nmovements. Her hematocrit dropped and she became hypotensive and\nwas transferred to the MICU as detialed above. Post-operatively,\nas the colon has been removed, it is the surgical teams\nintension that prednisone therapy may be tapered. She will\nrecieve on additional dose of 10mg of Prednisone on [**2170-7-13**] and\nthis may be discontinued. She should be monitored for signs of\nsteroid withdrawal.\n\n# PE/DVT: diagnosed in [**Month (only) 547**]. Her was initially INR elevated at\n6.8 on admission. When her INR <3.0, she was restarted on\nwarfarin therapy 10 mg po daily. Her INR then became\nsupratherapeutic once again, likely in the setting of\nconcomittant metronidazole administration. An IVC filter was\nplaced in anticipation of the patient needing a total abdominal\ncolectomy. The IVC filter will remain in place. Because of\nrecent bleeding and IVC filter, the patient remained on\nsubcutaneous heparin post-operatively until [**2170-7-11**] when she was\nrestarted on Coumadin therapy at 5mg daily. Her INR was 1.1 on\n[**2170-7-12**]. She will be discharged on 5mg of Coumadin daily with\nintention that the rehabilitation facility will work with the\npatient in achieving the goal INR of [**2-15**].\n\n# Anxiety/bipolar disorder: Patient was maintained on her home\nregimen of clonazepam, lorazepam, paliperidone. Social work and\npyschiatry were consulted for support and assistance with\nmanagement. Social work evaluated the patient post-operatively\nand beleived the patient was at her baseline. She should\ncontinue to be followed by her outpatient psychiatric provider.\n\n# Chronic pain: Patient's chronic pain was well controlled on\nhome regimen of oxycodone, oxycontin and tylenol.\nPost-operatively her managed with oxycodone and tylenol. The\npatient stated her pain was well controlled.\n\n# Chronic bronchitis: Stable. Continued on home spiriva and\nalbuterol.\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital 4316**] Rehabilitation & [**Hospital **] Care Center - [**Location (un) **]\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane).\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted to the hospital after an open total abdominal\ncolectomy for surgical management of your refractory ulcerative\ncolitis. You have recovered from this procedure well and you are\nnow ready to return home. Samples from your colon were taken and\nthis tissue has been sent to the pathology department for\nanalysis. You will receive these pathology results at your\nfollow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the\nsurgeon to contact you [**Name2 (NI) 19605**] these results they will\ncontact you before this time. You have tolerated a regular diet,\npassing gas and liquid stool through your ileostomy and your\npain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You are ready\nto be discharged to rehab today to continue your recover.\n\nPlease monitor your bowel function closely. If you have any of\nthe following symptoms please call the office for advice or go\nto the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal\ndistension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,\ninability to tolerate food or liquids, or constipation. Please\nsee ileostomy instructions below.\n\nYou have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a\nnew ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the\nstoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is\nvery high. The stool is no longer passing through the large\nintestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed\ninto the body and the stool becomes formed. You must measure\nyour ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from\nthe stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If\nyou find that your output has become too much or too little,\nplease call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse\npractitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the\nileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if you notice\nyour ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink\nsuch as gatoraide. Please monitor yourself for signs and\nsymptoms of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon\nstanding), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If you\nnotice these symptoms please call the office or return to the\nemergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. You\nmay eat an ileostomy appropraite regular diet with your new\nileostomy, please follow the advice of the ostomy nurses. Avoid\nspicy foods.\n\nPlease monitor the appearance of the ileostomy and stoma and\ncare for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. The stoma\n(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be\nbeefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times\nwhen touched and this should subside with time. The skin around\nthe ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the\nskin around the stoma for buldging or signs of infection listed\nabove. Please care for the ostomy as you have been instructed by\nthe wound/ostomy nurses. You will be able to make an appointment\nwith the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery, you\nwill be discharged to a rehab facility where nurses will assist\nyou to monitor your ileostomy until you are comfortable caring\nfor it on your own.\n\nYou have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed\nwith staples. The staples in this incision are far apart as you\nhad a difficult abdomen to close, there were wicks in these\nspaces which ahve since been removed. The incision should be\nmonitored closely and covered with adaptic and a dry sterile\ngauze dressing. The staples will stay in place until your first\npost-operative visit  when they are evaluated by the wound\nostomy nurse and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**]. Please monitor the incision for\nsigns and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at\nthe incision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the\nincision line, draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling\ndrainage, or if you develop a fever.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\n88yo male with history of coronary artery disease, CHF, DM, and\nprior DVT admitted with septic shock.\n.\n1. Septic shock\nHypotension is likely related to sepsis. The source of his\nsepsis is likely related to klebsiella and enterococcus found on\nblood cx, although the source of the GNR and enterococcus is\nunclear. His blood pressure improved rapidly with broad spectrum\nantibiotics and was weaned off of pressors within 48 hours.  He\nwas originally started on broad spectrum antibiotics which were\nnarrowed early on to ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  His\nenterococcus can back sensitive to ampicillin and he was switch\nfrom vancomycin to ampicillin on [**2160-6-1**].  His ceftriaxone's\nlast dose is due on [**2160-6-11**].  His last dose of ampicillin was due\non [**2160-6-11**].\n.\n2. ? Pneumonia\nHis chest Xray and CT scan were suggestive of pneumonia with\npossible empyema formation due to effusion with associated\nloculations. His CT scan also showed a persistent dense pleural\nplaque on the right. His pulmonary status however has remained\nstable during this hospitalization and he has improved without\nfurther intervention.  He had an oxygen requirement earlier in\nhis hospitalization but was weaned off to room air at the time\nof discharge. He is being treated with ceftriaxone and\nampicillin as detailed above.\n.\n3. Transaminitis\nThe patient had mildly elevated transaminases and total\nbilirubin. Priors from [**4-15**] were within normal limits. There is\nconcern that he could have mild hepatic congestion given his\nCHF. His transaminitis may also reflect systemic infection.\nThese should be redrawn to ensure that they normalize. On CT\nscan his liver showed two stable hypodensities which were likely\ncysts.  His ceftriaxone could be contributing to his increased\nAP.\n.\n4. Thrombocytopenia\nOn review of OMR, he had prior plts in the low 100's. His\nplatelets nadired at 73 and were 123 on the day of discharge.\n.\n5. Leukopenia\nDuring his admission, his white blood cell count declined from\n12 to 3. The etiology of this decline was thought likely related\nto sepsis or medication effect given the multiple different\nantibiotics he received.  His leukopenia normalized prior to\ndischarge.  His WBC count should be drawn again in 1 week.\n.\n6. CHF, chronic, diastolic:\nHis b-blocker and lasix were held in the setting of hypotension.\nThey were restarted prior to discharge.\n.\n7. CAD\nPlease review echo findings in result section.  He was continued\non his ASA and statin.  His b-blocker was held as detailed above\nand then restarted.  He had mildly elevated troponins which was\nconsistent with prior troponins present in our records.\n.\n8. DM\nHis home glipizide was held while in the hospital and restarted\nupon discharge.  He is being discharge on a humalog sliding\nscale.  He should be started on an ACE as an outpatinet.\n.\n9. CRI & cystitis\nHis creatinine was at his baseline of 1.1. A CT of the abdomen\nshowed pericystic stranding and apparent wall thickening\nsuggests a cystitis.  A CT scan also showed multiple bilateral\nrenal hypodensities measuring to 4.2 cm on the right, containing\nfluid- attenuating material, likely benign cysts\n.\n10. BPH\nFoley was placed with the help of urology to monitor urinary\noutput.  His tamsulosin was continued.\n.\n11. Prophylaxis\nHe was continued on heparin sc.\n.\n12. Code status: DNR/DNI\n\n",

He was\nafebrile and had no evidence of infection, no focal neurologic\ndeficits, and no nuchal rigidity to suggest meningitis.  He was\ngiven an Diazepam 20 mg IV shortly after arrival followed by\nanother 10 mg later in the morning.

She was\nresuscitated with crystalloid, having received 2 units at an OSH\nprior to admission. She complained of only minimal LUQ pain, and\nwas hemodynamically stable. Serial hematocrits were followed and\napproximately 24 hours after admission, she was noted to have an\nacute hematocrit drop from 34 on admit to 27. She was found to\nbe hypotensive to 80's/50s and was transiently fluid responsive.\nShe was transfused 2 u w/ good response. On HD 2 she was again\nfound to be hypotensive and her hematocrit at dropped to ~25, so\nshe was taken to the operating room for an open splenectomy. Her\nprocedure was uncomplicated and approximately 2 liters of blood\nwere evacuated from her abdomen. She returned to the SICU for\nher recovery. Serial hematocrits were continued to monitor for\nbleeding, and her post-op HCT was 23.9. She had an epidural\ncatheter placed for pain control and that was effective. Her\nthree vaccinations including Haemophilus, Pneumococcal and\nMeningococcal were administered in the ICU prior to transfer to\nthe floor.\n\nShe was transferred to the Surgical floor on [**2189-2-13**].  Her diet\nwas gradually advanced to regular and well tolerated.  She did\nhave an episode of disorientation, confusion and desaturation on\n[**2189-2-14**] presumed due to an increase in her epidural medication.\nWith decreasing the dose and agressive pulmonary toilet she\nimproved.  She was transitioned to oral pain medicationsand her\nepidural catheter was removed on [**2189-2-16**].. She required much\nencouragement to get up and ambulate but was eventually able to\nwalk independently.  Her Foley catheter was removed after her\nepidural catheter and she was voiding sufficiently. She is\ntolerating a regular diet without complaints of nausea and\nvomitting.  Her incisional pain is well controlled with oral\nanalgesics.\n\nShe is preparing for discharge home with follow-up with the\nAcute Care service in 1 weeks.

Emesis: Patient with coffee ground emesis concerning for an\nupper GI bleed. DDx includes peptic ulcer disease [**2-24**] H. pylori,\ngastritis, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear. Patient completed a Prev-Pack on\n[**1-9**] during his last [**Hospital1 18**] admission. Baseline hct is between\n25~33. Hct dropped from 30 to 25.3 in the setting of fluids.\nHad 2 PIVs for access throughout hospitalization. Was started on\nprotonix gtt at admission.\n.\nGI scoped the pt in the procedure room and found esophagitis,\ngastritis, and possible duodenal pathology (bxs taken).  He was\nreturned to the ICU setting and transferred to the floor in\nstable condition.  Pt was transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] protonix and\ncontinued this as an outpt (if needs prior auth, told to take\nomeprazole OTC 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] until PCP can fill out prior auth\npaperwork).  Pt had [**6-1**] pain in epigastrium when transferring\nout of ICU, which resolved without morphine on the floor.  N/V\nalso resolved on the floor.  Hct was trended and returned at 28\non the day of discharge. His diet was slowly advanced with\nclears--> regulars and he was only d/c'ed after ensuring he\ncould be discharged comfortably. Given UGIB, pt kept on tele\nthroughout admission. ASA was restarted at the time of d/c, and\nhe was set up with a f/u appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 2 weeks of\nd/c.\n.\n# Nausea: Precipitant of nausea is unclear at this time. DDx\nincludes diabetic gastroparesis vs abdominal pain from PUD vs\ngastroenteritis (less likely given no fevers). Was made NPO and\ntreated symptomatically with IV reglan which was successful.\nNausea resolved after the scope and supportive care.  He was\ndischarged on his regular home regimen of zofran PO.\n.\n#. CKD: Patient with chronic renal insufficiency [**2-24**] diabetes.\nBaseline Cre ~ 4.7, 4.4 at admission. Recent admission for\nissues with volume status requring brief MICU stay for hypoxic\nrespiratory distress. Although risk of patient for GI bleed,\nbenefit of restarting some blood pressure medications important\ndue to patient's known tenuous volume status.  Started on\nhydralazine 20 mg IV q6H while all other anti-hypertensives (po)\nwere held.  After the scope, his diet was restarted slowly and\nhe tolerated his PO medications well.  His BPs became less\nelevated when on his home regimen.  Of note, pt missed his\nnephrology appt as he is in house.  THis was rescheduled for him\nin 1 week's time (on [**2145-2-11**]) and as per the inpt renal team, he\nunderwent US of bilateral upper extremities in preparation for\nAV fistula placement in the future.  Also in preparation of HD\nin the future, hepatitis B panel was added on to facilitate\nnephrology f/u.\n.\n# Tachycardia: Patient initially tachycardic to 115s in the ED\nnecessitating MICU admission. DDx includes tachycardia from poor\npain control, continued nausea and vomiting, and reflex\ntachycardia from not being able to take his beta-blocker.\nHypovolemia from upper GI bleed also of concern, but Hct is low\nbaseline, and patient received aggressive fluid resuscitation\nwithout improvement to his tachycardia. HR stabilized to low\n100s once aggresive pain and blood pressure control initiated in\nthe MICU.  Once he was transferred to the floor, he was\nrestarted on his PO beta-blocker and his tachycardia resolved,\nso thought is reflex tachycardia from w/d of betablocker is\nlikely cause.\n.\n# Anemia: Pt's anemia (30 at time of admission and drop to 24 in\nICU) was likely a chronic issue (CKD necessitating epo in near\nfuture).  Of note, the low Hct was likely [**2-24**] dilutional effect\nfrom IVF.  Pt has had Fe studies in the past indicating ACD.  As\nsuch, will hold off on Fe supplementation at this time,\nespecially in the setting of gastroparesis.  Of note, may need\ncolonoscopy as an outpatient.  This will be deferred for GI f/u.\n (Of note, Hct on day of discharge was 27, and recheck in\nafternoon was 26.8).\n.\n# Leukocytosis: Likely in setting of stress from nausea,\nvomiting, and possible GI bleed.  Repeat WBC was wnl.\n.\n#. Diabetes mellitus: Continued on RISS and kept on [**1-24**] dose\nLantus with reglan continued for diabetic gastroparesis.  He was\ndischarged on his regular insulin regimen.  His blood sugars\nremained in good control in house.\n.\n# Anxiety/Depression: Continued on home lorazepam.\n\n",

Striking fecal loading within the colon, without obstruction.\n\n2. A focally dilated loop of small bowel in the mid abdomen\ncontains contrast and fecalized contents. There is also slowed\nmotility, though a stricture or ischemia are not excluded on\nthis study. Note is made on this study of atherosclerotic SMA\ndisease. 3. New hypodense collection anterior to the liver\nmeasures 1.6 cm, and is new compared with 6/[**2116**]. This may be a\nsmall postsurgical fluid collection. This is too small for\nintervention. Follow up MRI or PET CT may be of utility for\nfurther evaluation. 4. Mild ascites and mesenteric edema, which\nmay be reactive to relatively recent surgery. 5. The low rectal\nanastomosis appears intact, without surrounding fluid collection\nto suggest leak.\n\nCT Abd [**2117-1-18**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Compared to the prior study, the amount of fecal loading\nwithin the colon has improved. There are focally dilated loops\nof small bowel, likely\nmid-to-distal ileum, which when compared to the prior study,\nappear more\ndilated. 2. Again noted is atherosclerotic calcification of the\nabdominal aorta, focal low-attenuation lesion in the dome of the\nliver, loculated left pleural effusion. 3. Compared to the prior\nstudy, there is increased opacity in the left lower lobe.\nFindings are consistent with an inflammatory or infectious\netiology.  Aspiration should also be considered.\n\nCXR [**2117-1-18**]\nThe NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and should be\nadvanced. Current\nstudy demonstrates interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate in\nseverity. The\nleft mediastinal shift is unchanged. Loculated left pleural\neffusion has\nslightly increased in the interim. Bibasal opacities might\nreflect areas of infection, although they potentially could\nreflect interstitial edema as well. Evaluation of the patient\nafter diuresis is highly recommended.\n\nKUB [**2117-1-22**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Partial small bowel obstruction which is essentially\nunchanged from prior; however, the amount of retained enteric\ncontrast has slightly decreased. 2. Unconventional position of\nan NG tube should be correlated to functioning. No findings to\nsuggest free air.\n\nCXR [**2028-1-23**]\nIMPRESSION: No DVT in the left upper extremity. Findings were\ndiscussed in\nperson with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 12:15 p.m. on [**2117-1-24**].\n\nCXR [**2117-1-25**]\nIMPRESSION: Interval decrease in right basal opacity after\ndiuresis though\nthe residual remains concerning for pneumonia.\n\nVideo Swallow [**2117-1-29**]\nFluoroscopic video oropharyngeal swallow evaluation was\nperformed in\ncollaboration with the speech and swallow therapist. Thin\nbarium, thick\nbarium, and barium-coated cookie were administered. There is\npenetration with thin barium; however, no frank aspiration was\nobserved. For more details, please refer to speech and swallow\ntherapist note in the medical record.\n\nCXR [**2117-1-30**]\nIMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-22**] through [**1-27**]:\nLungs are severely hyperinflated. Previous bibasilar\natelectasis, quite\nsevere on the right, has entirely resolved. There is no\npulmonary edema.\nSmall residual bilateral pleural effusions are smaller still.\nHeart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax. A left PIC line\nends in the mid left\nbrachiocephalic vein. Findings are most consistent with severe\nbronchospasm as a cause of respiratory insufficiency. The larynx\nand subglottic trachea are not evaluated by this study.\n\nKUB [**2117-1-31**]\nThere is disproportionate distention of the large bowel with\nrespect to small bowel with abrupt change in caliber in the\nlarge bowel at the proximal sigmoid. Since there is formed stool\nin the rectum, this could be functional, such as a developing\ncolonic ileus. Leftward displacement of the rectum raises the\npossibility of an adjacent pelvic fluid collection, but it does\nnot directly compress the rectum or sigmoid. If there is concern\nfor hematoma or pelvic infection, CT scanning would be required.\nMaximum caliber of the right colon is 9 cm in the cecum and\nthere is preservation of normal haustral architecture and no gas\nin the wall of the colon. There is no pneumoperitoneum.\n\n[**Numeric Identifier 4684**] FLUORO GUID PLCT/REPLCT/REMOVE CENTRAL LINE Study Date of\n[**2117-2-2**] 1:07 PM\nIMPRESSION: Uncomplicated exchange of left-sided venous catheter\nfor a 5\nFrench 38 cm PICC with its tip at the mid SVC, under\nfluoroscopic guidance.  Please see above for details. PICC is\nready for use.\n\nEMG Study Date of [**2117-2-3**]\nClinicalFINDINGS: Unchanged small loculated effusion on the left with\ndecreasing\nextent of the retrocardiac atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No\nnewly\nappeared focal parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the\ncardiac\nsilhouette. Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube.\n\nUExt US [**2117-1-24**]\nFINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left\npleural effusion has mildly increased. There is increasing\nsubsequent atelectasis in the left retrocardiac lung areas.\nNewly appeared is a right lower lobe opacity, likely\nrepresenting a combination of pneumonia and pulmonary edema.\nUnchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. The\npresence of a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.\n\nCXR [**2028-1-26**]\nInterpretation: Abnormal study. There is\nelectrophysiologic evidence for a chronic neurogenic lesion\ninvolving the left recurrent laryngeal nerve with incomplete\nreinnervation. Evidence for synkinesis is also present. The\nright recurrent laryngeal nerve is normal.\n\n\nNeuro: During her stay and post-operatively, the patient\nreceived IV morphine as needed along with IV Tylenol, all with\ngood effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral\nintake and clears by speech and swallow to take pills orally,\nthe patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.\n\nCV: The patient was more or less stable from a cardiovascular\nstandpoint; She was intermittently tachycardic on the floor\nprior to surgery and in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after which was successfully\nmanaged with IV Lopressor (please refer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course\nbelow). Occasional hypertension was successfully treated with\nhydralazine.Vital signs were routinely monitored. The patient\nwas transitioned to home dose of Metoprolol and the patient's\nblood pressure was adequately controlled.\n\nPulmonary: The patient had some pulmonary issues during her\nhospital stay. Post operatively, she had some desaturation on RA\n(to the 80's) as well as increasing stridor. A CXR was\nconcerning for possible aspiration vs hospital acquired\npneumonia and she was started on a 10 day course of\nlevofloxacin. ENT was consulted for the apparent upper\nrespiratory obstructive stridor and it was found that her left\nvocal cord was non functional from a previous injury (possibly\nduring the CEA) and the right vocal cord was not functioning\nwell which is what likely contributed to the stridor. The pt was\ntransferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on POD 1 for respiratory precautions in\ncase of deterioration and need for intubation. Antibiotic\ncoverage was broadened on POD 3 to include vancomycin and Zosyn\ndue to a worsening CXR. Racemic epinephrine and Decadron\nimproved her symptoms. She never needed to be intubated and\neventually was satting well on RA. Please refer to the ICU\ncourse below for more details. She was transferred back to the\nfloor on POD4 with markedly improved stridor and dyspnea.\nThereafter, her saturations and vitals remained stable despite\noccasional subjective dyspnea while supine. ENT was following\nthroughout and noted improvement in the right vocal cord.\nAlbuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments were given every\n6 hours. Allvital signs were routinely monitored. The patient\nwas taken to the [**Hospital **] clinic for LEMG on [**2116-2-4**] which showed left\nvocal fold paralysis and right vocal fold paresis. The ENT\nattending recommended reassessment of motion this week, if no\nchanges would recommend observation given that her symptoms are\nstable. If symptoms worsen or limit her, will consider L. vocal\nfold\nBotox injection vs. temporary suture lateralization. The ENT\nteam was comfortable with diet per speech and swallow and\nprimary teams.\n\nGI/GU: Due to no improvement and in fact worsening obstructive\npicture, the pt ended up having an ex-lap on HD 8. Prior to\nthat, she was only having minimal flatus and bowel movements\nwith aggressive suppository treatments. She was kept NPO the\nwhole time. Post-operatively, the patient was also kept NPO for\na while aggressive awaiting return of bowel function. NGT tube\nwas removed on POD 2 due to very low output. A PICC line was\nplaced on POD 3 and TPN was initiated shortly thereafter. She\nhad bowel sounds throughout this whole time and abdominal\ndistention was improving. On POD 6 she began passing flatus. Due\nto the possible aspiration pneumonia and vocal cord issues, a\nspeech and swallow study was ordered before advancing her diet.\nShe failed this study. The next day, a video swallow study was\nordered which she passed and was allowed to start a diet with\nmany aspiration precautions in place. She was advanced to sips\non POD 7 which was tolerated well with no coughing or gagging.\nHowever, the next day she stopped passing flatus and had some\nabdominal distention and was thus made back to an NPO status.\nHer distention and obstipation continued to worsen and a KUB was\nobtained which showed colonic ileus. The patient was given\nbisacodyl suppositories in the mornings. On [**2116-2-5**] the patient\nwas passing flatus and having bowel movements. Her diet was\nadvanced from clear liquids to full liquids which were tolerated\nwell. On [**2117-2-5**] was advanced to ground mechanical soft diet with\nensure supplements. Because of prolonged NPO status the patient\nwas started on TPN and was followed closely by inpatient\nnutrition. The patient was to be discharged on TPN cycled\novernight with intention of tapering TPN as her PO intake\nincreased. Please see speech and swallow note attached to\ndischarge paperwork. The patient will need continued speech\ntherapy during her rehabilitation hospital stay.\n\nDue to urinary retention in the beginning, a Foley was placed.\nIt was removed on HD 8. It was again replaced on HD 9/POD1 for\nclose urine output monitoring given respiratory status and\ndesire to keep from fluid overload. It was removed on POD 5. She\nhad no urinary issues since and has been making adequate urine\non her own throughout the rest of her stay. Intake and output\nwere closely monitored.\n\nID: refer to the antibiotic regimen mentioned above in the\npulmonary section.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during\nthis stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as\npossible. The heparin was then administered in the TPN.\n\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:\n#Stridor: patient was scoped by ENT who noted sluggish vocal\ncords and recommended steroids. She received 3 doses of\ndexamethasone, racemic epinephrine nebs and ipratropium nebs\nwith some improvement in symptoms. She was kept on face mask in\nthe ICU and her O2 sat was stable. On repeat scope, she was\nnoted to have paralyzed left vocal cord with interval\nimprovement in right vocal cord. Left vocal cord paralysis\nsuspected to be chronic issue related to past surgeries.  Right\nvocal cord was hyperkinetic, likely stunning related to\nintubation.  Her stridor improved with time.\n\n#Healthcare acquired pneumonia: After patient's stridor\nimproved, she was noted to have continued O2 requirement and\nrepeat CXR showed a new RLL consolidation and she was started on\ntreatment for HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime on [**2117-1-25**].\n\n#Tachycardia: patient intermittently in sinus tachycardia,\nthought to be multifactorial including pain and anxiety. PE\nconsidered given recent surgery, however patient hemodynamically\nstable. Less likely hypovolemia given adequate UOP. Given her\nNPO status, her home metoprolol was converted to IV and\npatient's tachycardia responded well to metoprolol. Her pain was\ncontrolled with IV morphine prn and her anxiety was controlled\nwith Ativan prn.\n\n# Nutrition: As patient was NPO due to stridor and\npost-operative from abdominal surgery, a PICC line was placed\nand TPN was initiated.\n\n\nAt the time of discharge on  [**2116-2-6**] the patient was doing well,\nafebrile with stablevital signs, tolerating a regular diet,\nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted to the hospital  for a small bowel\nobstruction. This obstruction was managed conservatively with\nnasogastric tube decompression and intravenous hydration.\nHowever, you developed acute abdominal pain which required Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] to preform an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of\nadhesionss, and repair serosal defects. These adhesions were\nthought to be causing the obstruction. Prior to this procedure\nyou were noted to have a possible aspiration pneumonia on chest\nXray for which you were treated with a full course of\nLevofloxacin intravenously. After the additional surgery, you\ndeveloped airway difficulty called Stidor. The ENT doctors\nfollowed [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as well as speech and swallow. You have damage to\nyour vocal cords which will be followed by ENT as an outpatient\nand may require an injection. You should continue to follow a\nRegular Mechanical soft diet and follow chin tuck instructions\ngiven to you by the speech and swallow team. You were evaluated\nmultiple times at the bedside by the speech and swallow team and\nyou will be reevaluated at the rehab to progress your diet\nfurther after the repeat study of your vocal cords. Your bowel\nfunction has taken an extended period of time to return and you\nshould continue to eat small frequent meals of ground food.\nBecause you are not going to be able to meet your caloric needs\nright away from food alone, you will be discharged to rehab with\nan order for TPN and this will be gradually decreased overtime\nand eventually stopped. You will be discharged to rehab today.\nThe [**Hospital3 2558**] in [**Location (un) **] is very close to the hospital\nand if there is any issue, you can be brought back to the\nhospital easily. Please continue to participate in speech and\nphysical therapy.\n\nPlease monitor your bowel function closely. You have had a bowel\nmovement and are passing gas however, you have required\nassistance to do this by a suppository. You should not have\nprolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small\namounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected however, if\nyou notice that you are passing bright red blood with bowel\nmovements or having loose stool without improvement please call\nthe office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are\nsevere. If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a\nrisk that you will have some constipation. Please take an over\nthe counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms\ndoes not improve call the office. If you have any of the\nfollowing symptoms please call the office for advice or go to\nthe emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension,\nincreasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to\ntolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or\nconstipation.\n\nYou have a long vertical incision on your abdomen. The staples\nhave been removed, steri-strips applied, and the incision is\nintact. This incision can be left open to air or covered with a\ndry sterile gauze dressing if it begins to drain. If the\nincision begins to drain, please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the\ncolorectal surgery office. Please monitor the incision for signs\nand symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at the\nincision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the\nincision line, draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling\ndrainage, or if you develop a fever. Please call the office if\nyou develop these symptoms or go to the emergency room if the\nsymptoms are severe. You may shower, let the warm water run over\nthe incision line and pat the area dry with a towel, do not rub.\n\n\nNo heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless\ninstructed otherwise by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You may\ngradually increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy\nexercise with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\n\nYou will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication\nOxycodone. Please take this medication exactly as prescribed.\nYou may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take\nmore than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while\ntaking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive\na car while taking narcotic pain medication.\n\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care!

CT abdomen showed colonic wall\nthickening and fat stranding. Findings believed to be most\nconsistent with infectious colitis.\n.\n#. Colitis: Patient with no history of GI bleed presenting with\n3 days of deep red blood per rectum and abdominal pain. Patient\nwas hypotensive and initially admitted to the MICU.  Hct trended\nfrom 48.9 -> 41.1 -> 36.2 during hospital stay with IVF and 2\nunits PRBC were given in the MICU. Patient was likely initially\nhemoconcentrated from bloody bowel movements, as WBC was also\n20.5 -> 14.7 -> 17.4 with IVF. Surgery was consulted, and felt\nthis was unlikely to be ischemic colitis given symptoms did not\nbecome worse with food. GI was consulted, and felt colonoscopy\nshould be deferred until resolution of acute event. Most likely\netiology was determined to be infectious colitis, and symptoms\nimproved on Cipro/Flagyl. C. diff is possible given recent\nlevofloxacin use, and stool cultures were ordered for C. diff,\nSalmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, E-coli O157:H7,\nand HSV/CMV (given chronic prednisone use).  Stool cultures were\npending on discharge, and patient will follow-up as an\noutpatient.  Patient's leukocytosis resolved on Cipro/Flagyl and\nshe was discharged on 10 days of Cipro/Flagyl.  Patient was also\nstarted on Atovaquone for prophylaxis given her chronic steroid\nuse.  She was also discharged on a brief course of Morphine\nuntil the resolution of her acute abdominal pain.  She was\ninstructed not to take her home Percocet while taking the\nMorphine.\n.\n# Hypotension: Likely hypovolemic with creatinine up to 1.0 from\nbaseline of 0.6 in setting of abdominal pain and decreased po\nintake. Does meet SIRS criteria but sepsis unlikely in this\nwell-appearing woman. Patient's hypotension responded to NS IVF\nand BP recovered to 100's-140's systolic.  Home Lisinopril and\nNifedipine were held in setting of recent hypotension and GI\nbleed, and patient was instructed to continue holding Lisinopril\non discharge until follow-up.\n.\n# Asthma/COPD: 2-4L home O2, FEV1/FVC 45% on [**12-29**] and patient of\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**].

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\n69F who was admitted to the Neuro ICU for SAH, L PCOMM aneurysm.\nShe had a EVD and a A-line was placed at bedside on admission.\nNeo was started for BP control. She was placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]\nmonitor, a Bicarb drip was initiated after a bolus for metabolic\nacidosis, and she was medically paralyzed to stabilize her\nrespiratory status. A bedside echo was done and showed a EF >\n50%, and neo was weaned off while uptitrating levophed. On [**2-4**]\nmorning she was on CMV 100% with a PEEP of 16, PO2 was 62, she\nwas started on Dopamine and Levophed. Patient appeared to be in\nrespiratory acidosis. In the afternoon, she remained on CMV 100%\nwith a PEEP of 14, PO2 86 with a lactate of 4.9. We started IV\nAmicar for vasospasm.\n\non [**2-5**] Amicar was discontinued and the patient traveled to\nAngio. Left Pcomm artery aneurysm was coiled and secured but not\ncompletey. Vasospasm was not detected on the study.\nOn [**2-6**] dilantin level was corrected to 21 therefore standing\ndose was decreased. EEG was initiated.\n\nOn [**2-7**] Pt remained neurologically stable but was becoming more\nagitated and biting the ET tube. Propofol was started and neuro\nchecks were changed to Q2h. Overnight, patient spike a\ntemperature to 101.5 and was pancultured.\n\nOn [**2-8**], patient continued to bite on ET tube when propofol is\noff. A pneumothorax in the LUL was seen on CXR after\nreintubation and chest tube was placed at bedside. On\nexamination she briskly localized with her RUE and LUE\nlocalized, but was slower than R to noxious stimuli, BLE\nwithdrew. CTA/P was done which showed\n\nShe remained stable, underwent a cerebral angiogram on [**2139-2-10**]\nwhich showed moderate vasopsasm in the left ICA. She recieved\nintraarterial verapamil injections.  She remained pressed\n180-200 for sys bp.  Her chest tube was removed later that same\nday.\n\nOn [**2-11**], she went to angio and received Verapamil 10mg total\n(5mg to each ICA). Her exam remained stabled and her EVD was\nraised to 25cm. On [**2-12**], her exam remained stable and her EVD\noutput was low and ICPs remained stable. Her EVD was clamped. On\n[**2-13**], it was reported that there was CSF leaking from the EVD\nsite, a Head CT was stable, exam and ICPs remained stable. Her\nEVD was re-opened to 25 and she continued to re-leak so the EVD\nwas dropped to 20. On [**2-13**] she also recieved 1 unit of PRBC's\nand as she continued to leak following her EVD beign dropped to\n20 it was again lowered this time to 15cm H2O.\n\nOn [**2-14**] she underwent a CTA of the head which was stable and\nshowed no vasospasm and subsequently her BP was liberalized to\n100-200 systolic. Her neuro checks were also liberalized to\nevery 4 hours, CSF was sent for culture, and general surgery was\ncontact[**Name (NI) **] in preparation of VP shunt placement which was planned\nfor [**2-16**].  On [**2-15**] she remained stable in the ICU and on [**2-16**]\nshe was taken to the OR for VP shunt placement. Her post-op CT\nshowed a subacute left MCA infarct that was not noted in her\n[**2-14**] CTA. A CTA was obtained that showed moderate to severe\nspasm on the L MCA. Her SBP was kept at 180-200 and started on a\nNeo drip. On [**2-17**], she was given Albumin, she was maxed on her\nNeo and Levophed was started. On exam her right side was more\nsluggish. She was taken to angiogram which appeared improved,\nbut did receive Verapamil. EEG was ordered. Later in the\nevening, she appeared more lethargic, a Head CT was done which\nshowed a L IPH that appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion from\nthe L MCA infarct. She was taken off pressors. She also had a\nHCT drop and on [**2-18**] was given 2 units of PRBC and had a CT\nabd/pelvis which did not show any bleed. A repeat head CT was\ndone which showed minimal spasm of the left MCA.  Patient was\nobserved to have a diffuse rash on her torso which was thought\nto be a drug rash due to Vancomycin. This antibiotic was\ndiscontinued and the patient will be followed closely for\ndeveloping fevers.\n\nOn [**2-24**], she remained stable. Her venting settings were weaned\ndown from the day prior and the patient is now tolerating CPAP\nwith a FIO2 of 41%. Her PEG was placed without difficulty.\n\nOn [**2-25**] her exam remained stable.\n\n\n",

Diffuse bilateral subarachnoid\nhemorrhage with intraventricular extension without significant\nchange compared with the CT head. 2. Left posterior\ncommunicating artery aneurysm (neck: 4mm, widest point: 5mm,\nheight 8mm). A 4 mm daughter aneurysm is present at the\nposterior base of the aneurysm.\n3. The right A1 segment of the ACA is small and this may\nrepresent spasm vs congenital variation. No other findings to\nsuggest vasospasm.\n\n[**2-4**]IMPRESSION: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function.\nMild tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n[**2-5**] Head CT:IMPRESSION: 1. Persistent diffuse subarachnoid\nhemorrhage as described above. Increased intraventricular\nhemorrhagic extension.\n2. Right frontal ventriculostomy catheter ends in the prepontine\nnear the\nBasilar artery; the relationship between the catheter tip and\nartery cannot be accurately determined on this non-contrast\nstudy. Recommend reivew of these images by the clinician to\nassess if the position of the tip is appropriate/desired.\n3. Some degree of superimposed diffuse cerebral edema.\n\n[**2-5**] Cerebral Angio: ****\n\n[**2-6**]- EEG:\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG, due to the\npresence of a\n[**4-3**] Hz theta frequency background seen throughout most of the\ntracing,\nwith frequent periods of superimposed 0.5-1 Hz diffuse delta\nslowing,\nwhich occasionally becomes semi-rhythmic. This pattern is\nconsistent\nwith a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, commonly caused by\nmedication\neffect, metabolic disturbance, or infection. In addition, on\n[**2-7**] at 6\npm and on [**2-8**] at 9 am, there was a generalized suppression of\nthe\nrecord, which corresponded to increased propofol administration.\nThere\nare occasional bifrontal sharp discharges, although less\nfrequent and of\nlower amplitude than in the previous tracing, suggestive of a\ncortical\nirritability. There were no focal abnormalities or\nelectrographic\nseizures noted.\n\n\n[**2-8**] CTPIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular\nextension.\n2. Hypodensity in the cingulate gyri bilaterally concerning for\nacute/subacute ischemia.\n3. Regions of focal narrowing in the ACA and MCA branches\nsuggestive of\nvasospasm, although not changed since CTA of [**2139-2-3**].\n4. No abnormality seen on the perfusion maps.\n\n\n\n[**2-10**] CXR /IMPRESSION: Minuscule left apical pneumothorax.\n\nCT Head [**2139-2-13**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Interval decrease in the degree of subarachnoid hemorrhage\noverlying the cerebral hemispheric convexities bilaterally.\n\n2. Stable degree of intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the\noccipital\nhorns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally and decreased degree\nof hemorrhage within the fourth ventricle. No change in\nventricular size compared to [**2139-2-8**].\n\n3. Decreased confluent hypodensities within the bilateral\ncingulate gyri\ncompared to [**2139-2-8**], may represent improving vasospasm.\n\nCT Head [**2139-2-14**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. CT head is unchanged from previous CT examination of\n[**2139-2-13**] and\ndemonstrates subarachnoid and intraventricular blood and mild\nventriculomegaly. No new hypodensities to suggest evolving\ninfarcts.\n2. CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of\nvasospasm. Subtle narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery\nunchanged from previous CTA examination.\n\nCT Head [**2139-2-16**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. New left MCA branch infarction.\n2. Stable appearance of subarachnoid bleed.\n\nCTA Head [**2139-2-16**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. There is a new large region of left hemisphere hypodensity\nand sulcal\neffacement involving left MCA distribution (please see series 2,\nimage 23), likely representing a large new infarction which was\nnot definitely present on the prior study at 2:31 hours the same\nday.\n2. The early subacute left MCA infarction within the left MCA\ndistribution, which was present on the prior study, is slightly\nlarger than on the prior study and shows evolution.\n3. The diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular\nhemorrhage are\nunchanged. No new hemorrhages are identified. The ventricles are\nprominent\nand stable. The ventricular catheter is unchanged in position.\n4. CTA of the head demonstrates a small right M1 segment which\nis similar to that seen on the prior study, [**2-14**], although\nsmaller compared with the study on [**2-3**], likely representing\ncontinued vasospasm of this vessel. No new foci of vascular\nstenosis are identified. No focus of left MCA occlusion is\nidentified to explain the possible new left acute large\ninfarction as described above.\n\nCT Head [**2139-2-18**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n5 x 3 cm left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Unchanged\nbilateral\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage and right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]\nintraventricular hemorrhage.\n\nNOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The left parietal process\nrepresents\nhemorrhagic conversion of the pre-existent evolving infarct in\nthe left MCA, superior division territory, demonstrated on the\nmost recent cranial CTA (on [**2139-2-16**]).\n\nCT Abd/Pelvis [**2139-2-18**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding.\n2. Colonic diverticulosis.\n3. Bibasilar opacities at the lung bases could be atelectasis;\nhowever,\ncannot exclude aspiration or superinfection.\n4. Hypodensity in the left renal pelvis, presumably a left\nparapelvic cyst, suboptimal evaluation due to lack of IV\ncontrast.\n5. VP shunt and post-pyloric tube in place.\n\n[**2-19**] CTA/ CTP\nCT ANGIOGRAM: The vertebral and carotid arteries and all major\nbranches are patent. Narrowing of the left MCA M1 segment is\nsimilar to that seen on prior studies on [**2-16**] and [**2-14**]\nconsistent with stable vasospasm. There is no evidence of\narterial occlusion, aneurysm or AV malformation. Remaining MCA\nand ACA branches are normal in caliber. The PCA branches are\nnormal with the exception of a fetal-type anatomy.\n\nPERFUSION: Increased mean transit time and decreased cerebral\nblood flow are seen in the left occipital lobe corresponding to\nthe area of hemorrhagic infarction. Mean transit time is\nincreased and blood volume is decreased in the left insular\ncortex.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Persistent left occipital lobe hemorrhagic infarction with\ncorresponding perfusion defects consistent with infarction.\n2. Persistently narrowed left MCA M1 segment, consistent with\npersistent mild vasospasm.\n\n\n[**2-22**] lower extremtiy dopplers\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral\nlower\nextremities.\n\n[**2-23**] CXR for line placement:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. New left PICC, tip at cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.\n2. Standard position of a right paramedian catheter, left\nsubclavian line,\nnasointestinal tube and tracheostomy.\n3. Low lung volumes with possible minimal pulmonary edema.\n\n\nEcho:FINDINGS:\nROUTINE SAMPLING: An unreactive [**4-3**] Hz theta frequency\nbackground is\nseen throughout the tracing. There are frequent periods of\nsuperimposed\n0.5-1 Hz diffuse delta slowing, which occasionally becomes\nsemi-rhythmic. There are occasional bifrontal sharp waves seen\nduring\nthe periods of delta slowing, although less frequent and of\nlower\namplitude than the previous tracing. In addition, on [**2-7**] at 6\npm and\non [**2-8**] at 9 am, there was a generalized suppression of the\nrecord\ncorresponding to increased propofol administration.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were numerous spike detections,\nwhich\ndid not include any epileptiform discharges.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 25 seizure detection\nprograms,\nwhich did not include any epileptiform discharges.\nPUSHBUTTON EVENTS: There were no pushbutton events.\nSLEEP: The patient did not exhibit any normal features of sleep\narchitecture.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm between 80-90\nbpm.\nFINDINGS:\n\nThere is still extensive residual subarachnoid hemorrhage with\nextension into the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles\nbilaterally. There is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter\nwhich ends in the prepontine cistern. The patient is status post\nleft PCOM coiling with streak artifact limiting local\nassessment. There is a new hypodensity in the right cingulate\ngyrus concerning for ischemia. The midline structures are\ncentral. The ventricular configuration remains stable.\n\nCT PERFUSION: The perfusion maps do not demonstrate evidence of\ndelayed\ntransit or reduced blood flow or blood volume.\n\nCTA HEAD: Regions of focal narrowing in the ACA and MCA branches\nare\nsuggestive of vasospasm. The left PCOM has a fetal\nconfiguration. The\nremaining branches of the vertebrobasilar system are patent\nwithout evidence of significant stenosis, aneurysm or vascular\nmalformation.\n\nFINDINGS: There is a miniscule left apical\npneumothorax. Left chest tube is seen in unchanged position with\ntip near the left apex. Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged.\nNo new consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  Heart size is\nnormal. Tracheostomy is in unchanged position. Right-sided\ncentral line is seen with tip at the cavoatrial junction.\nIntestinal tube traverses below the diaphragm with tip out of\nview.\n\nFINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler images of bilateral common\nfemoral,\nsuperficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed. There is\nnormal\ncompressibility, flow and augmentation. Flow is seen in the\nveins of the\ncalf.\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - always.\nLevel of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.\nActivity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or\nwheelchair.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nAngiogram with Embolization and/or Stent placement\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou will need to return for completion of  your coiling in one\nmonth's time.

At the time of first examination, the patient\nhad a large ecchymosis but no hematoma over her left\nhip/buttock.  Her head and C-spine CTs were negative for acute\nabnormality.  When examined 2 hours later, this area had grown\nsignificantly in size suggesting an actively bleeding hematoma.\nA CT of her torso was done showing large hematoma in the left\ngluteal region with active extravasation.  After this scan, her\nhematocrit was rechecked which had dropped from 37 to 22.  She\nwas thus  consented and taken to the angiography suite where\nactive extravasation was demonstrated at the L5 segmental\nartery.  This artery was coiled and bleeding was stopped.\nDuring angiography, she received 2 units of PRBC with\nsignificant improvement in hematocrit to 33.  Post-angio, she\nwas admitted to the TSICU where she was monitored closely.

Patient was initially\nfound by police wandering in [**Doctor Last Name 6641**] after making nonsensical\nphone calls to his office. CT scan at OSH revealed a\nnondisplaced dens fracture. CT head was negative.  Pt was noted\nto be confused, inattentive and confabulating. Urine tox screen\nwas positive for opioids, which was expected given patient's\nrecent vicodin use for neck pain. AMS was attributed to vicodin\nand alcohol withdrawal(TSH was wnl, no evidence of ischemia, CE\nwere negative, B12, folate were wnl.)  Patient was treated with\ndaily thiamine, folate and multivitamin along with standing\nvalium and haldol with PRN ativan. Mental status improved\nconsiderably and by the time of discharge he appeared to be\nclose to his baseline (although his wife states that his\ncognition has declined overall in the past six months)  PCP may\nwant to consider outpatient neuropsychiatric testing to evaluate\nfor underlying dementia on the account of his long history of\ndrinking.  Repeat head CT to eval for possible subacute subdural\nbleeding was negative.   I discussed with the patient the\nimportance of alcohol cessation and he showed some insight and\nwas in agreement that he should stop drinking.  He was seen by\npsychiatry and social work, and he did not want to be enrolled\nin a program for his drinking, stating that \"I will do it on my\nown\".\n.\n# fevers/Leukocytosis: in the ICU, pt was treated for aspiration\nPNA with unasyn ([**Date range (1) 90782**]) and azithro ([**Date range (1) 80435**]); sputum\ncx is sensitive to levofloxacin so it was switched on [**11-3**].  He\ncompleted a ten day course of levofloxacin while in the hospital\n.\n#. Dens fracture - CT C-spine shows nondisplaced type II dens\nfracture.  Ortho spine recommends  8-12 weeks of wearing the\n[**Location (un) 2848**] J collar. No surgical intervention is recommeded.  He was\ncounselled not to drive, and he will see the orthopedic surgeon\nin outpatient followup in the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**].  He was\ncounselled at great length to avoid any narcotic analgesics for\nneck pain, and to take tylenol or motrin as needed.\n.\n#HTN - Restarted home PO metoprolol.\n.\n#Mobility:  patient required use of a walker.  He was evaluated\nby physical therapy, who felt that he could return home as long\nas he was under strict supervision.\n\n#Insomnia:  [**Name (NI) **] wife states that he often returns to\ndrinking on account of insomnia.  I gave him a prescription for\ntrazodone.\n\n",

Patient is a poor historian in the\nED, confabulating and hallucinating.  Per report from wife, he\nhad fallen on [**2197-10-21**], and was experiencing headache and neck\npain.  For the next two days, he tried using heat and cold\npacks, tylenol, ibuprofen, all without improvement of symptoms.\nOn [**10-24**], he went to his doctor's office, saw one of the PAs\nthere, and was given a prescription for vicodin and flexeril\nwhich did not give him any relief.  On [**10-25**], he again saw his\nPCP and had Xray of his neck performed which was reported to be\nnormal, so he was told to double his dose of vicodin.  On [**10-26**],\npatient was noted to be hallucinating, leaving messages on his\nwife's voicemail who was out of town.  He was also calling for a\ndog which wasn't there, telling nonsensical stories.  Last night\nhe had gone over to his neighbors house and told them there\nwhere 8 kids in his living rooom.  His wife called EMS at that\ntime, but he refused to go, and so they didn't take him.  Today,\nhe called his work and told them that he was training a new\ndriver, they had made a wrong turn, and the driver left him out\nin the [**Doctor Last Name 6641**].  Police found him wandering the neighborhood and\nbrought him to OSH where he had a CT scan of his neck which\nshowed acute dens fracture.\n.\nIn the ED inital vitals were, 99.7 80 143/93 20 96%.  Patient is\nin a hard collar.  Mental status noted to be very altered.  Was\nseen by ortho spine service who did not recommend surgical\nrepair at this time, and recommended [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar for\nstablization of fracture, and MRI of C-spine.  Neurology also\nevaluated the patient, noted that he was confused, inattentive,\nand confabulating.  He was witnessed to be talking to people who\nweren't there.  No focal neurologic deficits were noted.  CT\nhead did not show any acute intracranial findings.  Neurology\ncomments that his encephalopathy, mild intention tremor, and\nataxia, are likely due to his chronic alcohol use.  [**Name (NI) **]\nwife reports that he goes through at least 2 liters of Southern\nComfort a week.  No history of DTs or withdrawal that the wife\nknows.  [**Name2 (NI) **] was given thiamine and folic acid.  MRI of\nC-spine was unable to be performed in the ED as no one from his\nfamily was available to discuss safety checklist.\n.\nPatient was initially assigned a medicine floor bed, however\ndeveloped tachycardia to the 150's along with hallucinations,\nconcerning for alcoholic withdrawal and alcoholic hallucinosis.\nHis serum alcohol tox screen was negative.  He required physcial\nrestraints as he was very agitated.  Was given diazepam IV 10 mg\nx1, haldol 5 mg IV x2, and multiple administrations of IV\nlorazepam.  Heart rate improved to 110s, but patient's mental\nstatus remains altered.  No changes to his overall neurological\nexam.  Vitals prior to transfer to the ICU were:  afebrile,\n130/80s, HR 116, 18, 99%RA.\n.\nOn the floor, patient is very sedated, not responding to\nquestions, not following commands.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nMs [**Known lastname 24642**] was admitted to the trauma ICU [**4-18**] after being\nintubated in the ED.\nIn brief, she was intubated HD1 through HD6, she went to the OR\nHD 3 & 4 for fracture repair, and displayed slowly improving\nmental status.\n\nHer course in the ICU is summarized below:\n\n[**4-18**]: She was weaned off pressors using fluid resuscitation. On\narrival to the ICU, a CVL was inserted. Her neuro exam was\nstable, following no commands but spontaneously moving all four\nextremities and opening eyes intermittently. She was placed on\nlogroll precautions given her T6 fracture.\n[**4-19**]: She received 1 unit pRBC for hematocrit of 23. To\nfacilitate frequent neurologic exams, she was frequently weaned\nfrom sedation. During one of these weans, she self-extubated and\nwas subsequently re-intubated. Her neurologic exam was slowly\nimproving in that she was squeezing hand intermittently on\ncommand and spontaneously moving all extremities.\n[**4-20**]: She was taken to the operating room by orthopedics for\nORIF of radius and olecranon and placed in a R arm cast. Also on\nthis day her ETT was converted to a nasotracheal tube to\nfacilitate OMFS operating on her mandible the following day.\nGiven the operative procedure, frequent neuro exams were\ndeferred.\n[**4-21**]: She was taken to the operating room by OMFS for closed\nreduction mandible fracture and jaw wiring. Her neuro exam had\nnot progressed, still intermittently following commands, but\ntypically not interactive. She had a carotid series performed\nwhich confirmed there was no injury to her vessels. She was\nfitted with a TLSO brace as neurosurgery felt her T6 fracture\nwas best treated in this manner. A family meeting was held to\ndiscuss her lack of neurologic progression. The prospect of a\ntracheostomy was discussed and it was decided if she had not\nprogressed by HD 7 a tracheostomy would be performed.\n[**4-22**]: Her neuro exam showed some improvement, following commands\nmore often.\n[**4-23**]: Her neuro exam showed significant improvement. She was\nmuch more alert and interactive so was deemed safe for\nextubation. The nasotracheal and nasogastric tubes were removed\nsimultaneously which she tolerated well. She worked with phyical\ntherapy who had her sitting on the side of the bed in her TLSO\nbrace. She remained significantly delerious but was regularly\ndirectable and not agitated. She was kept NPO as her NGT had\nbeen removed and her mandible was wired.\n[**4-24**]: A speech and swallow evaluation showed inability to\nswallow apropriately. A DHT was placed and tube feeds were\nstarted. They were advanced to goal.\n[**4-25**]: She was screened for rehab and is awaiting aproval. She\nwas transferred to a regular hospital floor.\n\nHer remaining hospital course after transfer from the ICU to the\nfloor as follows by systems:\n\n",

Your wrist fracture was also repaired and\nyou should avoid putting weight on your right wrist until you\nhave follow up with the Orthoepdic specialist who will upgrade\nyour weight bearing status.\n\n*The wire cutters will need to stay at the bedside at all times\nin the event of a respiratory emergency and/or if vomiting\noccursthe wires should be cut.\n\nPostoperative instructions following jaw surgery\n\nWound care: Do not disturb or probe the surgical area with any\nobjects. The sutures placed in your mouth are usually the type\nthat self dissolve. If you have any sutures on the skin of your\nface or neck, your surgeon will remove them on the day of your\nfirst follow up appointment. SMOKING is detrimental to healing\nand will cause complications.\n\nBleeding: Intermittent bleeding or oozing overnight is normal.\nPlacing fresh gauze over the area and biting on the gauze for\n30-45 minutes at a time may control the bleeding. If you had\nnasal surgery, you may have occasional slow oozing from your\nnostril for the first 2-3 days. Bleeding should never be severe.\nIf bleeding persists or is severe or uncontrollable, please call\nour office immediately. If it is after normal business hours,\nplease come to the emergency room and request that the oral\nsurgery resident on call be paged.\n\nHealing: Normal healing after oral surgery should be as follows:\nthe first 2-3 days after surgery, are generally the most\nuncomfortable and there is usually significant swelling. After\nthe first week, you should be more comfortable. The remainder of\nyour postoperative course should be gradual, steady improvement.\nIf you do not see continued improvement, please call our office.\n\nPhysical activity: It is recommended that you not perform any\nstrenuous physical activity for a few weeks after surgery. Do\nnot lift any heavy loads and avoid physical sports unless you\nobtain permission from your surgeon.\n\nSwelling & Ice applications: Swelling is often associated with\nsurgery. Swelling can be minimized by using a cold pack, ice bag\nor a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel, with firm\napplication to face and neck areas. This should be applied 20\nminutes on and 20 minutes off during the first 2-3 days after\nsurgery. If you have been given medicine to control the\nswelling, be sure to take it as directed.\n\nHot applications: Starting on the 3rd or 4th day after surgery,\nyou may apply warm compresses to the skin over the areas of\nswelling (hot water bottle wrapped in a towel, etc), for 20\nminutes on and 20 min off to help soothe tender areas and help\nto decrease swelling and stiffness. Please use caution when\napplying ice or heat to your face as certain areas may feel numb\nafter surgery and extremes of temperature may cause serious\ndamage.\n\nTooth brushing: Begin your normal oral hygiene the day after\nsurgery. Soreness and swelling may nor permit vigorous brushing,\nbut please make every effort to clean your teeth with the bounds\nof comfort. Any toothpaste is acceptable. Please remember that\nyour gums may be numb after surgery. To avoid injury to the gums\nduring brushing, use a child size toothbrush and brush in front\nof a mirror staying only on teeth.\n\nMouth rinses: Keeping your mouth clean after surgery is\nessential. Use 1 teaspoon of salt dissolved in an 8 ounce glass\nof warm water and gently rinse with portions of the solution,\ntaking 5 min to use the entire glassful. Repeat as often as you\nlike, but you should do this at least 4 times each day. If your\nsurgeon has prescribed a specific rinse, use as directed.\n\nShowering: You may shower 1-2 days after surgery, but please ask\nyour surgeon about this. If you have any incisions on the skin\nof your face or body, you should cover them with a water\nresistant dressing while showering. DO NOT SOAK SURGICAL SITES.\nThis will avoid getting the area excessively wet. As you may\nphysically feel weak after surgery, initially avoid extreme hot\nor cold showers, as these may cause some patients to pass out.\nAlso it is a good idea to make sure someone is available to\nassist you in case if you may need help.\n\nSleeping: Please keep your head elevated while sleeping. This\nwill minimize swelling and discomfort and reduce pain while\nallowing you to breathe more easily. One or two pillows may be\nplaced beneath your mattress at the head of the bed to prop the\nbed into a more vertical position.\n\nPain: Most facial and jaw reconstructive surgery is accompanied\nby some degree of discomfort. You will usually have a\nprescription for pain medication. Some patients find that\nstronger pain medications cause nausea, but if you precede each\npain pill with a small amount of food, chances of nausea will be\nreduced. The effects of pain medications vary widely among\nindividuals. If you do not achieve adequate pain relief at first\nyou may supplement each pain pill with an analgesic such as\nTylenol or Motrin. If you find that you are taking large amounts\nof pain medications at frequent intervals, please call our\noffice.\nIf your jaws are wired shut with elastics, you may have been\nprescribed liquid pain medications. Please remember to rinse\nyour mouth after taking liquid pain medications as they can\nstick to the braces and can cause gum disease and damage teeth.\n\nDiet: Unless otherwise instructed, only a cool, clear liquid\ndiet is allowed for the first 24 hours after surgery. After 48\nhours, you can increase to a full liquid diet, but please check\nwith your doctor before doing this. Avoid extreme hot and cold.\nIf your jaws are not wired shut, then after one week, you may be\nable to gradually progress to a soft diet, but ONLY if your\nsurgeon instructs you to do so. It is important not to skip any\nmeals. If you take nourishment regularly you will feel better,\ngain strength, have less discomfort and heal faster. Over the\ncounter meal supplements are helpful to support nutritional\nneeds in the first few days after surgery. A nutrition guidebook\nwill be given to you before you are discharged from the\nhospital. Remember to rinse your mouth after any food intake,\nfailure to do this may cause infections and gum disease and\npossible loss of teeth.\n\nNausea/Vomiting: Nausea is not uncommon after surgery. Sometimes\npain medications are the cause. Precede each pill with a small\namount of soft food. Taking pain pills with a large glass of\nwater can also reduce nausea. Try taking clear fluids and\nminimizing taking pain medications, but call us if you do not\nfeel better. If your jaws are wired shut with elastics and you\nexperience nausea/vomiting, try tilting your head and neck to\none side. This will allow the vomitus to drain out of your\nmouth. If you feel that you cannot safely expel the vomitus in\nthis manner, you can cut elastics/wires and open your mouth.\nInform our office immediately if you elect to do this. If it is\nafter normal business hours, please come to the emergency room\nat once, and have the oral surgery on call resident paged.\n\nGraft Instructions: If you have had a bone graft or soft tissue\ngraft procedure, the site where the graft was taken from (rib,\nhead, mouth, skin, clavicle, hip etc) may require additional\nprecautions. Depending on the site of the graft harvest, your\nsurgeon will [**Location (un) 8146**] you regarding specific instructions for\nthe care of that area. If you had a bone graft taken from your\nhip, we encourage you to ambulate on the day of surgery with\nassistance. It is important to start slowly and hold onto stable\nstructures while walking. As you progressively increase your\nambulation, the discomfort will gradually diminish. If you have\nany problems with urination or with bowel movements, call our\noffice immediately.\n\nElastics: Depending on the type of surgery, you may have\nelastics and/or wires placed on your braces. Before discharge\nfrom the hospital, the doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8146**] you regarding these\nwires/elastics. If for any reason, the elastics or wires break,\nor if you feel your bite is shifting, please call our office.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\n**You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] for an appointment with the Oral\n[**Hospital 110270**] Clinic.

Pt became hypotensive, may have had a vagal event. Also\nmay having been having hypoxia that could have contributed. ABG\non arrival to ICU was 7.2/53/76 on FiO2 80%. CXR with possible\neffusion on left and pulm edema. IP was consulted but did not\nrecommend tapping the pleural fluid. He was weaned and extubated\non [**2112-2-24**] and did not require further ventilatory support.\n.\n# CAD: hx of recent angioplasty to Lcx [**12-22**], was on plavix\nsince. No reported recent CP. Pt may have had demand ischemia\ndue to hypotension/PEA arrest and afib with RVR. His CE were\ntrended but negative for ACS and his lipitor/ASA/Metoprolol were\n restarted.\n.\n# CHF: Pt has a hx of dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF\nof 20%. CXR showed pulm edema. Lasix gtt was stated with goal\n-1L per day but stopped on [**2112-2-24**] as patient appeared\neuvolemic. Given the low EF, afterload reduction was achieved\nwith ACE-i, BB and lasix gtt. On the day of discharge, he\nappeared euvolemic with Cr at baseline and minimal crackles on\nexam without O2 requirement.\n.\n# RHYTHM: had afib with RVR post PEA arrest, now s/p\ncardioversion and is v-paced. BP improved with cardioversion.\nHad TEE with no thrombus in OR, and will need to be\nanticoagulated. Pt has a hx of some compliance issues with\ncoumadin per OMR. His coumadin was continued with INR goal [**12-31**].\nHe was also continued on his home dose of digoxin 0.125mg.\n.\n# Chest pain: thought to be [**12-30**] CPR, CE were flat, was on\ntylenol and given a dose of morphine however he became delirious\nwith medication and further pain control was achieved with\nTylenol and Toradol. He pain waxed and waned over the course of\nhis admission but had essentially disappeared on discharge.\n.\n# Abdominal pain: Patient with increasing abdominal pain during\nhis CCU stay with increased T-bili (although AST/ALT nl). He\nunderwent Abdominal U/S on [**2112-2-28**] that revealed moderate ascites\nand biliary sludge. A paracentesis was attempted but not\nperformed [**12-30**] the small amount of ascitic fluid on repeat U/S.\nHis pain decreased over the the course of his stay and was well\ncontrolled with tramadol and occasional toradol.  On discharge\nhe had only mild discomfort with no peritoneal signs.\n\n# Diarrhea: Patient had c-diff sent but was not positive. His\nbowel regimen was held and this symptom gradually improved\nduring his hospitalization.\n\n# HTN: BP was normotensive off pressors in the first 48hrs post\nPEA arrest and treated thereafter with [**Last Name (un) **] (valsartan) which was\nintermittently held for low SBP 80-90s.\n\n# UTI: patient developed fevers with a positive U/A, he was\ntreated with Bactrim that was changed to Cefpodoxime for total\ncourse of 7 days.\n.\n# HLD: stable and chronic, he was continued on lipitor\n.\n# DMII: stable, pt maintained on NPH 15 units [**Hospital1 **] with SSI with\nhumalog\n.\n# CRF: baseline Cr is 1.2. Pt was thought to be at risk for ATN\ndue to hypotension. His Cr/UOP were trended and Cr returned\nclose to baseline prior to discharge.\n.\n# Depression/Mental status: Patient was continued on home SSRI,\nhe became agitated on [**2112-2-24**] [**12-30**] morphine and require a dose of\nzydis 5mg.

After he was intubated he had a CVL placed\nand became hypotensive. He was given IVF and neo, then changed\nto epi. He then had a PEA arrest for about 1 minute with\ncompressions and was given epi bolus x 1 with a return of a\npulse. He was continued on a epi gtt. He was then in afib with\nRVR HR in 120s. EP was called and then interogated his\npacemaker, did a TEE with no thrombus, and he was cardioverted\nwith 100 J x 1, and then 200 J x 1 to a paced rhythm. He also\nhad hypoxia with low saturations during the above event\nrequiring FiO2 of 100%. He had reported pleural effusions on his\necho. The OR team attempted to place a CT on the left, but were\nunable to due to adhesions. His inital ABG post arrest was pH\n7.07 pCO2 78 pO2 62. No CXR was done prior to transfer. Pt was\nalso given Vecuronium x 1 in the OR. Pt was given 1500ml IVF\ntotal per anesthesia.\n\nOf note he had many admissions over the last calendar year for\ndifficult to control CHF. His last admission was on [**2111-12-22**] at\nwhich time he had a Cath with a angioplasty to his Lcx and was\nstarted on plavix.\n\nROS, unable to complete due sedation.\n\n",

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nPt is 46 yo F with hx of IVDU, HCV, hx of cellulitis and\nosteomyelitis who p/w chronic non-healing ulcers [**3-1**] heroin use\nb/l and fever, found to have MSSA bacteremia and aortic valve\nendocarditis.\n.\n# MSSA Bacteremia - blood cultures ([**3-3**]) bottles from admission\npositive for MSSA. The most likely source is the bilateral\nchronic non-healing ulcers [**3-1**] heroin use. Though pt reports not\nhaving used heroin in the past 6 months, ulcers have not healed\ndespite dressing changes at home. On admission, ulcers appeared\ninfected and pt was febrile. Pt was started on IV nafcillin for\nMSSA, to complete a total 6-week course. Of note, pt has history\nof MSSA infections in the past (abscesses, bacteremia, and R\nsided endocarditis) for which she completed nafcillin courses.\nPt also had history of thoracic osteomyelitis in [**2144**] treated at\n[**Hospital1 2025**], though this was considered as possible source of bacteremia\non this admission, it seems less likely given no clinical\nsymptoms of back pain and more likely source of ulcers. Pt\nrefused MRI imaging, but should consider outpatient open MRI if\ndoes not continue to have improvement. All surveillance cultures\nsince admission have had no growth to date. As described below,\npt was found to have aortic valve vegetation and infective\nendocarditis with no abscess seen on TEE.\n.\n# Endocarditis - in setting of MSSA bacteremia, pt was found to\nhave 1.4cm vegetation on aortic valve, new since echo in [**3-9**],\nwith moderate aortic insufficiency. Started on 6-week course of\nIV nafcillin as above. Cardiology and CT surgery were consulted\nand did not recommend acute surgical intervention given\nbacteremia and no decompensated heart function. Daily ECGs did\nnot show any abnormalities, pt had hypotension to SBP 100\nthroughout most of hospital stay and one episode of fever to\n100.5 a week into therapy; given this, a TEE was done to\nevaluate for cardiac abscess and was negative for this.\n-Patient was transferred into MICU after code was called on\nfloors for hypoxic respiratory failure.  This respiratory\nfailure was quickly reversed with diuresis and NIMV, and was\nthought to be [**3-1**] severe aortic valve insufficiency in the\nsetting of patient anxiety.  Similar episodes occurred\nintermittently in the ICU with any mild increase in SVR, so\npatient was kept with sedative/opiate regimen to stave off\nanxiety.  Cardiac surgery was consulted, and it was agreed that\nsurgical correction of valve was only viable therapeutic option.\n.\n# Inguinal ulcers - [**3-1**] long-standing heroin use though pt\nreports no use for past 6 months. She had been doing daily\ndressing changes at home though these ulcers were likely\ninfected on admission (6x6cm in L anterior thigh area, 2x2cm in\nR). Wound care and plastic surgery were consulted, plastic\nsurgery did not recommend surgical debriding, pt had wet-to-dry\ndressing changes three times a day which required 1mg IV\ndilaudid for pain control beforehand. Once pt completes\nantibiotic course for bacteremia and endocarditis, she will\nfollow up with plastic surgery to consider flap placement to\nensure healing. Pt had bilateral venous stasis changes and 1+\nedema below knees, in addition to leg elevation and\nbetamethasone cream, she was diuresed with lasix and had\ndecrease in edema and pain in legs.\n.\n# Acute renal insufficiency - likely pre-renal given poor PO\nintake recently and infection. Cr improved to 1.3 today, FeNa\n2.5% and FeUrea 52% both of which suggest resolution of\npre-renal state\n- encourage PO intake\n- continue to trend Cr\n.\n# Hypotension - now improved, SBP 110s-120s. Given aortic valve\nvegetation, will maintain high suspicion for valve dysfunction\ncontributing to hypotension.\n- encourage PO intake\n- monitor on tele, daily ECGs\n- continue abx as above\n.\n# Anemia - chronic, HCT baseline 26-27, [**Month/Day (2) **] studies in [**2145**]\nrevealed likely etiology as anemia of chronic inflammation. [**Year (4 digits) **]\npanel indicates likely ACI, no evidence for hemolysis. HCT\nbumped appropriately to 1U RBC. HCT stable today.\n- T+S, PIV\n- peripheral smear - no schistocytes\n- B12 / folate - normal\n.\n# Anxiety - continue home 1mg TID ativan\n.\n# HCV - \"inactive\", never treated for this. Pt had liver biopsy\nin [**6-6**] which showed fibrosis with no clear etiology for\nhepatomegaly. She follows in [**Hospital **] clinic here. Recent poor\nappetite and weight loss is concerning for malignancy, though\nAFP not elevated.\n- outpt work-up for ?malignancy\n- LFTs stable\n\n# IVDU - pt reports being clean for 6 months\n- social work",

No spontaneous echo contrast\nor thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial\nappendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial\nappendage. Left atrial appendage velocity >20m/sec. A small\natrial septal defect is present with left to right flow. No\nbubbles were seen in the left heart following injection of\nagitated saline.\nThere is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The\nleft ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters are\nmost consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular\ndiastolic dysfunction.\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThe diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels\nare normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta,\naortic arch, and the descending thoracic aorta.\nThere are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets\nare severely thickened/deformed. There is mild aortic valve\nstenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Peak/mean gradients are\n39/20mm/Hg. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral\nregurgitation is seen.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of the results in person prior to the start\nof the procedure.\nPost-Bypass:\nPatient is A-paced an on a phenyephrine infusion s/p CABG/AVR.\nThere is a well seated #25 bioprosthetic aortic valve. There is\nno evidence of peri-valvular leaks or regurgitation. Peak and\nmean gradients are 23/9 mmHG with a cardiac output of 8.\nLV function is preserved with an estimated EF>55%. No wall\nmontion abnormalities are noted.\nTrace MR+TR remain.\nA Left pleural effusion is identified.\nThere is no echocardiographic evidence of an aortic dissection\npost de-cannulation.\nThe remainder of the exam is unchanged.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\nElectronically signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5209**], MD, Interpreting\nphysician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2114-7-30**] 15:42\n.\n\n[**2114-8-1**] 07:08PM BLOOD WBC-7.4 RBC-2.87* Hgb-9.1* Hct-27.2*\nMCV-95 MCH-31.6 MCHC-33.4 RDW-12.7 Plt Ct-85*\n[**2114-8-1**] 03:34AM BLOOD WBC-7.8 RBC-2.84* Hgb-9.1* Hct-26.6*\nMCV-94 MCH-31.9 MCHC-34.0 RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-79*\n[**2114-8-1**] 07:08PM BLOOD Glucose-132* UreaN-25* Creat-0.9 Na-136\nK-3.9 Cl-102 HCO3-29 AnGap-9\n[**2114-8-1**] 03:34AM BLOOD Glucose-130* UreaN-22* Creat-0.9 Na-135\nK-4.3 Cl-101 HCO3-29 AnGap-9\n[**2114-8-1**] 07:08PM BLOOD Mg-2.0\n[**2114-8-1**] 03:34AM BLOOD Mg-2.3\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\nLife Care Center of [**Location (un) 5165**]\n\nDischarge Condition:\nAlert and oriented x3 nonfocal\nAmbulating with steady gait\nIncisional pain managed with Percocet\nIncisions:\nSternal - healing well, no erythema or drainage\nLeg Right- healing well, no erythema or drainage.\nEdema- trace bilat\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nPlease shower daily including washing incisions gently with mild\nsoap, no baths or swimming until cleared by surgeon.

Given this\naspiration occured she was evaluated by speech and swallow and\nrecommended thin liquids and regular diet.  She continued to\nhave shortness of breath over the course of [**8-7**].  CTA\nrevealed a large left pleural effusion.  She received IVF fluids\non [**8-31**] for orthostasis and again on [**9-1**] for frank hypotension\nfelt [**3-9**] dehydration.  In this setting, concern was raised for\nvolume overload.  She was treated by optimizing rate control,\nand gentle IV lasix on [**9-3**].  Her dyspnea was not markedly\nchanged with lasix, and her atrial fibrillation and hyponatremia\nworsened.\n.\nGiven poor response to lasix, and ongoing tachypnea (with\nnegative CTA), discussion was held over the possibility of\ntherapeutic thoracentesis.  The effusion is new as it was not\npresent on prior CXR on [**2111-8-14**] with her oncologist.  After\ndiscussion with her oncologist ([**Last Name (un) 82949**] Anamur, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82950**]),\nthis effusion was felt to be malignant (her lung ca is located\nin the LUL and had improved s/p XRT), and felt likely to\nreaccumulate.  Her prognosis was felt to be poor given 2 primary\nmalignancies, and her inability to tolerate chemotherapy.\n.\nAfter extensive discussion with the patient, her daughter [**Name (NI) **]\n(HCP), the patient declined thoracentesis, and elected to change\ngoals of care to comfort measures only.  She was treated with\noral ativan and morphine for respiratory comfort.  She will be\ndischarged to hospice.  She may receive lasix prn dyspnea,\nhowever these efforts have been limited by tachycardia and\nhypotension during this hospitalization.\n.\nOn the day of discharge, the above plan was again communicated\nto the patient, and her son-in-law [**Name (NI) **] (alternate HCP) as her\ndaughter [**Name (NI) **] was not available.\n.\n# dizziness - pt complained of dizziness after starting\nantibiotics.  her neurologic exam was non-focal.  head CT was\nunremarkable for metastasis.  she demonstrated no nystagmus or\nevidence of BPPV.  her dizziness was attributed to orthostasis\nand medication.  her neurontin, percoceet and flagyl were\ndiscontinued with mild improvement in her symptoms.  she is\nbeing discharged to hospice with prn meclezine.\n.\n# diarrhea - likely [**3-9**] antibiotics, and improving at the time\nof discharge.  she had stool cultures x3 negative for cdiff, and\ngeneral stool culture negative on [**9-2**].  she will be discharged\nwith prn lomotil.\n.\n#. Atrial fibrilation: Pt is rate controlled on dilt and amio at\nhome, though she is not anticoagulated.  She had intermittent\nepisodes of breakthrough RVR in 120-130s in the icu thought\nlikely due to underlying aspiration PNA and hypoxia.  She\nremained asymptomatic with the RVR, diltiazem regimen was\ntitrated up and metoprolol was added to acheive better rate\ncontrol.  Her heart rate ranges between 80-120 on this regimen\nand BP remains stable.  She did develop pleural effusions in\nthis setting requiring intermittent diuresis, as above.\n.\nShe is being discharged to hospice on her regimen of metoprolol,\ndiltiazem, and amiodarone for comfort, as she becomes anxious\nwhen she senses a rapid heart rate.\n.\n#. Esophageal + Lung Ca: pt with 2 primary malignancies,\nincluding T3N1 esophageal  adenocarcinoma, with squamous cell\nlung cancer s/p XRT, both diagnosed in [**2110**].  She is not a\nchemotherapy candidate per discussion with her oncology provider\n(above).  She received a palliative esophageal stent placement.\n.\nAs above, she is being discharged to hospice given large left\npleural effusion and ongoing dyspnea\n\n#. Depression: She is continued on home citalopram.\n\n#. Post herpetic neuralgia: She had herpes zoster 7 weeks prior\nwith residual pain. She had sedation/somnolence on neurontin so\nthis was held, and liquid percocet was attempted.  Given ongoing\ndizziness, neurontin and percocet were discontinued with some\nimprovement.  Her pain was controlled with tylenol.  She will be\ndischarged to hospice with morphine as above.\n.\n#. Hypertension: Previously hypertensive, for which she was\ncontinued on diltiazem, up titrated as above with metoprolol for\nrate control.  She subsequently was treated with IVF for\nhypotension felt likely [**3-9**] dehydration and poor po intake.\n\n#. COPD: She only uses albuterol at home.\n#. GERD: continue PPI for comfort.\n#. Hyperlipidemia: simvastatin was discontinued.\n.\n# CODE STATUS - pt made DNR/DNI after extensive discussion with\nfamily and patient. she is being discharged to hospice with\ncomfort measures only, and understands no further role for\nhospitalization as she is not interested in thoracentesis or\nfurther surgical procedures to treat her malignancy, and is not\na chemotherapy candidate.\n.\n# CONTACTS: [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 82951**] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82952**] (cell)\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 82953**] (home), [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 82951**] [**2111**], [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 82954**],\ngreater lowel family practice, [**Doctor Last Name **], [**Hospital1 **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82955**].\n[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 82956**].\n\n",

CN II ?????? XII\ngrossly intact. Moves all 4 extremities. Strength 5/5 in upper\nand lower extremities. Patellar DTR +1. Plantar reflex\ndowngoing.\nSKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis. No ecchymoses.\n\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nCXR [**2111-8-24**]: An esophageal stent extends from the level of the\ncarina to the upper stomach, pinched to about half its general\ndiameter at the level of the left atrium.  Mediastinum is\nshifted to the left. Dense left perihilar consolidation could be\npneumonia, could also be radiation change, and mass. Heart is\nmoderately  enlarged whether due to cardiomegaly or pericardial\neffusion is indeterminate.\nLarge irregular opacity obscuring the apex of the aortic knob\ncould be a\npleural or lung mass or just atelectasis. Small to moderate left\npleural\neffusion is present. Any prior imaging of the chest should be\nobtained for comparison purposes to determine the nature and\nsignificance of the multiple findings described above.\n.\nCXR [**2111-8-25**]: Progression of the left lung consolidation with a\nnew left-sided pleural effusion. The appearences are again very\nlikely secondary to aspiration.\n.\nCXR [**2111-8-26**]: Interval worsening of left upper and left lower\nlobe consolidation that might represent a combination of\naspiration and atelectasis. The heart size is unchanged. There\nis no pneumothorax.\n.\nCXR [**2111-8-28**]: There is improvement in the left upper lobe\nconsolidation, with persistent left lower lobe consolidation and\na new left sided pleural effusion with left lower lobe and\nlingular atelectasis. Mediastinal silhouette and esophageal\nstent are unchanged.\n.\nCXR [**2111-8-28**]: No short interval change in appearance of the left\nlung, with\nfindings likely representing a combination of consolidation and\natelectasis combined with a moderate left pleural effusion.\nConsidering presence of volume loss, CT may be considered to\nexclude an obstructing process if warranted clinically. Cardiac\nsilhouette remains enlarged and mediastinum remains widened.\nEsophageal stent is unchanged in appearance. Increasing\ninterstitial opacities in right lung likely reflect asymmetric\nedema from fluid overload, and there is persistent right basilar\natelectasis and adjacent small effusion, unchanged.\n.\nCTA [**2111-8-28**]: 1. No pulmonary embolism.\n2. Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,\nwith associated atelectasis. Given cardiomegaly, these findings\nmay represent congestive heart failure.\n3. Small amount of secretions within the right lower lobe\nbronchus and\nlayering of material within the lower esophageal wall stent.\nAspiration is a diagnostic possiblity.\n4. Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary\nhypertension.\n5. Probably patent lower esophageal stent. However, please note,\nstent patency or stenosis cannot be directly assessed on this\nevaluation and a barium esophagram could be performed for\nfurther assessment as clinically indicated.\n.\nECG [**2111-8-25**]: Sinus rhythm with a single ventricular premature\nbeat. Low limb lead voltage. No previous tracing available for\ncomparison.\n.\nECG [**2111-8-25**]: Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Poor R wave\nprogression. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2111-8-25**] the\nventricular premature beat is absent and artifact is new.\n.\nCXR [**2111-9-1**]:\nLarge multiloculated left pleural effusion has changed in\ndistribution but not in overall severity. Left lower lobe is\nstill collapsed. Left upper lobe atelectasis has improved. Small\nright pleural effusion is stable or slightly  increased.\nPulmonary vascular congestion persists, but I see no pulmonary\nedema. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by adjacent pleural\nabnormality but is probably large though unchanged. No\npneumothorax. Lower esophageal stent unchanged in position.\n.\n[**2111-9-2**] VIDEO SWALLOW:\nIMPRESSION: Minimal penetration with thin consistency barium.\nOtherwise,\nnormal oropharyngeal swallowing evaluation. Please refer to the\nfull notes by speech and swallow pathologist from the same date,\ndetailed in the treatment recommendations.\n.\n[**2111-9-3**] CT HEAD:\nINDINGS: There are diffuse hypodense areas in the bilateral\nfrontal lobes\nand periventricular regions likely representing small vessel\nischemic disease. There are no masses. There are no areas that\nenhance inappropriately with contrast. There is no disturbance\nof the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white delineation.

PPM interrogation was\nunremarkable. The patient did receive his beta blocker the night\nbefore the implantation on [**2112-2-23**]. The patient was also plavix\nloaded with 300mg prior to the procedure. The patient tolerated\nthe procedure well and post-procedure echo showed resolution of\naortic stenosis with a well-seated valve, with an EF of 55%. He\nwas completely asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint\nupon discharge.\n\n# NYHA CLASS IV DIASTOLIC CHF: Patient has hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy, with moderate-severe R dCHF, moderate L dCHF.\nDuring his last admission, he was diuresed with Lasix 40mg IV\nbolus once, and achieved euvolemia. Home torsemide and\nmetoprolol were continued. Patient is on home O2 (2L per NC) at\nnight, and continued this during hospitalization. Diuresed as\nnecessary to achieve euvolemia.\n.\n# CAD: Pt is s/p stent to LAD and D1 ([**4-/2106**]) and s/p diagonal\nstent ([**2106**]). Most recent cath at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**11/2111**]) revealed no\nobstructive CAD.\n- continue home metoprolol tartrate 25mg PO bid, pravastatin\n20mg daily and ASA 81mg. ASA increased to 325mg for TAVI\nprocedure.\n\n# Atrial Flutter: Pt has history of AFlutter s/p ablation, then\ntachy-brady s/p PPM. Also has history of chronic AFib, for which\nhe was just switched to pradaxa from coumadin. We continued home\ndigoxin 0.125 and home metoprolol tartrate 25 [**Hospital1 **]. He did have a\nbit of oozing from his left groin site, this was fixed with\nlocal lido/epi and pressure bandages. Given his several\nhospitalizations for epistaxis we discussed the risk benefit of\nanticoagulation with his hematologist/oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**],\nwho agreed with us that given his CHADS2 score of 4 with an\nannual stroke rate of 8% and no major bleeds, anticoaggulation\nwould still be indicated, and the patient agreed with this plan.\nHe was continued on warfarin.\n.\n# Diarrhea: Patient initially presented with nausea, vomitting\nand diarrhea. C diff toxin was negative. His symptoms were\nthought to be due to a viral gastrointestinal syndrome and\nresolved with supportive measures prior to his procedure.\n\n# Anemia: Patient with a clear iron deficiency anemia on labs\nfrom [**2112-2-9**] (iron of 31, ferritin of 26, TIBC of 463). Patient\nhas a recent GI bleed admission in [**2109**] with stable HCTs and\ncolonscopy being a poor study but EGD showing erosive gastritis.\nThe patient showed no signs of GI bleed during his\nhospitalization. He received 1 unit of PRBCs for a HCT of 25.5,\nand discharge HCT was 28. The patient's PCP will be notified of\nhis anemia and that a screening colonoscpy (given the poor\nstudy) would be indicated in the future.\n\n# HTN: continued home metoprolol, as per above.\n.\n# HLD: continued home pravastatin.\n.\n#.OSA: pt has been on CPAP. PFTs actually show more of a\nrestrictive pattern. He is on home O2 at night, which was\ncontinued during hospitalization. We continued 2L home O2 and\nCAP nightly.\n.\n#.CKD: baseline creatinine 1.2, stable throughout last\nhospitalization. Creatinine remained stable at 0.8 upon\ndischarge.\n.\n#.NIDDM: diet-controlled.

He was also diuresed with lasix and\nachieved euvolemia, maintained on 2L oxygen, which he is on at\nhome.\n\nSince his last discharge, patient has been feeling well.  He had\none episode of severe epistaxis requiring packing by an ENT at\n[**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  Per the patient, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was aware of this\nand oversaw his care, and his pradaxa dose was decreased.\nPatient stopped taking pradaxa the day prior to admission in\nanticipation of [**Last Name (STitle) **] procedure.  Patient has not had any\nmore episodes of epistaxis since then.\n\nAdditionally, while receiving 2 units of pRBC at [**Location (un) 620**] on\n[**2-19**], he developed abdominal pain which he thought was reflux,\nbut was not relieved by tums.  He was admitted for cardiac\nenzyme monitoring, out of concern abd pain could be cardiac in\netiology.  Troponins were trended and were 0.074, then 0.102,\nthen 0.121. CK-MB flat.  Subsequently, he developed diarrhea,\n[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] report 10 episodes in one day.

Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45\n%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\nnormal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic\naorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely\nthickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis\n(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.\nModerate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe\n[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a very small\npericardial effusion.

Moderate mitral regurgitation\npersists.\n\nECHO [**2112-2-25**]\nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular\ncavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal\n(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal\nfree wall contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic\nfunction is likely more depressed given the severity of\ntricuspid regurgitation.] The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.\nAn aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] prosthesis is present. The aortic valve\nprosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion\nand transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There\nis moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The prosthetic aortic\nvalve leaflets appear normal The transaortic gradient is normal\nfor this prosthesis. Very mild (1+) paravalvular aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to\nacoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be\nsignificantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-2-25**],\nvery mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation is now seen and the\nestimated PA systolic pressure is now lower.\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\nBased on [**2106**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended.

Antihypertensives were held.  The patient received 6-7L\ntotal in the ED and on admission to the ICU.  During her course\nin the ICU, her blood pressure improved.  Hypotension may be\nmultifactorial including continuing blood pressure medication\nusage in setting of hypovolemia from poor PO intake. She\nunderwent ECHO for a cardiac source of hypotension, but was\nfound to have normal biventricular function.  AM cortisol level\nwas normal, making adrenal insufficiency an unlikely source of\nher hypotension.  She was started on vancomycin and zosyn for\nbroad spectrum coverage for possible sepsis. She was then\ntransferred to the general medicine floor afebrile and without\nan elevated WBC count.\nUpon admission to the general medicine floor, her hypotension\nwas resolved. Her antibiotics were discontinued when it was\ndetermined that she was unlikely to have sepsis. Her blood\npressure remained in the 130s-160s/80s-100s. She was maintained\non diltiazem 45mg PO QID for the remainder of her admission.\nHer blood pressure eventually stabilized in the 120s/80s.\n.\n#Abdominal pain - Patient complained of abdominal pain of\napproximately 2 months' duration, diffuse, throughout the\nabdomen, but not radiating elsewhere. During her admission on\nthe general medicine floor, she also began complaining of sharp\nepigastric and RUQ tenderness, without radiation. Her abdomen\nwas distended and tympanitic. She had bilateral CVA tenderness.\nPancreatic enzymes were only mildly elevated, AST/ALT/bili were\nnormal, and abdominal ultrasound and CT were negative for\nabdominal pathology, making an acute cholecystic, pancreatic,\nhepatic, or obstructive GI process unlikely. A tTG-IgA was\nnormal, excluding celiac disease. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy\non [**7-23**] showed mild esophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis with\n\"feline esophagus\".  An H. pylori serum antibody titer was\npositive. She was prescribed PrevPac triple therapy\n(lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin) on discharge for\nH. pylori eradication.  A colonoscopy on [**7-25**] showed several\nsmall pedunculated polyps, which were excised and sent for\npathological review; there was no evidence of acute malignant\nprocess. Her abdominal pain was thought to be due to a\ncombination of GERD associated with H. pylori, poor PO intake,\nand some minor constipation. However, a functional GI pain\netiology could not be excluded and she was recommended to follow\nup with her PCP.\n.\n# Protein-energy malnutrition - Patient admitted with poor PO\nintake.  [**Month (only) 116**] have inadequate access to food given financial\nsituation. Other considerations include malabsorption, poor\nintake secondary to financial considerations.  She was\ndetermined to have moderate protein-energy malnutrition based on\nlow albumin on admission, which resolved after eating. A\nnutrition",

She remained ambulatory but missed\nseveral medical appointments.\nAround [**7-12**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] began having difficulty obtaining food\ndue to financial constraints.

Social work also followed the\npatient regarding resources for food.  She was referred to Meals\non Wheels and [**State 350**] Elder Services for assistance.\n.\n# Fatigue - The patient presented with several days of fatigue.\nThe differential diagnosis was broad in this elderly patient -\ntoxic/metabolic, endocrine, neoplasm, psychiatric\n(pseudodementia vs. dementia).  The patient's TSH returned low,\nmaking hypothyroidism an unlikley source of her fatigue.  LFTs,\nB12 were within normal limits.  Age appropriate cancer screening\nincluding abdominal ultrasound, CT, and colonoscopy did not\nreveal a source for her fatigue.  It was thought that her\nfatigue was most likely related to poor nutrition. She was\nrecommended to follow up with her PCP for further workup.\n.\n# Acute renal failure - The patient was admitted with a\ncreatinine of 2.8 (baseline 1.0).  Urine electrolytes were\nconsistent with pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine improved with\nthe administration of IV fluids to below 1.0.  Nephrotoxins were\navoided throughout admission.  Medications were renally dosed.\n\n.\n# Hyponatremia - The patient was admitted with a sodium of 129.\nIt was hypovolemic in origin, as it normalized with the\nadministration of IV fluids.\n.\n# Hyperglycemia - Patient presented with hyperglycemia on\nadmission (Glc 133) in setting of poor PO intake. No known\nhistory of DM.  She was started on fingersticks QID with an\ninsulin sliding scale.  The patient was found to have an A1C of\n6.0.  Blood glucose eventually fell to below 120 on maintenance\nD5NS and was below 100 by the time of discharge.\n.\n# Eosinophilia - Her eosinophilia on CBC was mild and chronic,\nand she had a full workup in the outpatient setting.  There were\nno lung findings.  Stool for O&P negative.  It remained stable\nthroughout admission. There was no evidence of acute parasitic\nor autoimmune process.\n.\n# Anxiety/Depression - The patient was continued on home\ncitalopram throughout admission.  Quetiapine was initially held\nin the ICU but was restarted upon transfer to the general\nmedicine floor.\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital 119**] Homecare\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane).\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nIt was a pleasure to care for you during your hospitalization at\n[**Hospital1 18**]. You were initially admitted to the hospital for low blood\npressure, fast heart rate and weakness. These symptoms were\nconsistent with a condition called \"hypovolemia\" or dehydration\ndue to poor liquid and food intake. You were given IV fluids to\ncorrect this condition and it is now stable.\n.\nOnce we gave you enough fluid, you had a high blood pressure,\nwhich we treated with blood pressure medications. Please\ncontinue to take your diltiazem and make sure to have your blood\npressure checked by your primary care doctor at your follow-up\nappointment.\n.\nWhile in the hospital, you also complained of abdominal pain. We\nperformed multiple blood tests, radiologic scans, and endoscopic\nexams to look for the cause of your abdominal pain. Your\nabdominal CT scan showed no visible problems in your abdomen,\nbut did show a protruding disc in your spine. Your upper GI\nendoscopy showed esophagitis, or inflammation of the esophagus\nwhich connects the throat to the stomach. We started you on a\nmedication called prevpac to control the stomach acid and help\neradicate a GI bug called H.pylori. Your colonoscopy showed 4\nbenign-appearing polyps but an otherwise normal colon. The\nrecommendations are to have a repeat colonoscopy in 2 years from\nnow and have a follow-up appointment with the GI team that saw\nyou in the hospital.\n\nWe were concerned that you were malnourished when you were\nadmitted to the hospital, due to lack of access to food and\nfinancial difficulty. We have contact[**Name (NI) **] [**State 350**] Elder\nServices and you will be receiving Meals on Wheels starting this\nMonday. If you have difficulty affording food, please call Elder\nServices to access resources to help you.\n.\nYou also complained of fatigue while in the hospital. We did\nblood tests to evaluate your fatigue, and we believe that it is\nmost likely due to poor nutrition. Please follow up with your\nprimary care doctor if your fatigue continues.\n.\nOur blood tests showed that you had poor kidney function when\nyou arrived at the hospital, most likely due to poor liquid\nintake. Your kidney function improved with good hydration.\nPlease continue to drink abundant liquids to protect your\nkidneys.\n\nMEDICATION CHANGES:\nPlease start taking prevpac for 10 days. This is a drug that\nwill help eradicate a bacteria that we found in your stomach\ncalled H.pylori\nWhile you are taking your prevpac, please do not take your\ntrazodone\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: [**Hospital3 249**]\nWhen: THURSDAY [**2127-7-31**] at 4:10 PM\nWith: [**Company 191**] POST [**Hospital 894**] CLINIC [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 895**]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\nGastroenterology - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**]\n[**Hospital1 69**] [**Hospital Ward Name 517**]\n[**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2127-8-15**]:20am\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**]\n\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1112**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2334**], M.D. Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 253**]\nDate/Time:[**2127-8-4**] 3:00\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 542**], DPM Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 543**]\nDate/Time:[**2127-9-17**] 9:30\n\nDepartment: [**Hospital3 1935**] CENTER\nWhen: MONDAY [**2127-8-4**] at 3:00 PM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1112**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2334**], M.D. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 253**]\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\nDepartment: PODIATRY\nWhen: WEDNESDAY [**2127-9-17**] at 9:30 AM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 542**], DPM [**Telephone/Fax (1) 543**]\nBuilding: Ba [**Hospital Unit Name 723**] ([**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Complex) [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Street Address(1) 592**] Garage\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2127-7-26**]"

During his hospital\ncourse, he was found to have worsening ascites. Conservative\nmanagement was attempted, and a drain was placed. Over time, the\nfluid had increasing levels of amylase and became increasingly\nbiliary, and on exam, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was increasingly peritoneal.\nHis hospital course was complicated by worsening respiratory\nstatus as well, and he was started on Levaquin for PNA w/\nincreasing O2 requirement, which, in conjunction with his\ndeteriorating abdominal exam prompted transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for\nfurther management and evaluation on [**2114-8-24**].\n\n",

He was recently admitted\nto [**Hospital3 7362**] for alcohol detoxification and to address his\ndepression and suicidal ideation. He was discharged on [**2114-8-7**]\nto a homeless shelter and on [**2114-8-9**] noted the onset of severe\nleft-sided abdominal pain in the context of chronic epigastric\npain. He presented to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital ED and was admitted. He\ndenied nausea, vomiting, fevers at the time. He did report an\nepisode of diarrhea prior to admission. A CT scan was performed\nand identified a 10 cm pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.\nWBC on admission was 11.3, TBili .9, alk phos 78, AST 54, ALT\n25, amylase 673, lipase 114.\n\nHe was admitted to a medical floor and treated conservatively.\nRepeat CT scan on [**2114-8-15**] showed increasing pleural effusions\nand ascites and a paracentesis was performed on [**8-16**].  2.7\nliters of bloody fluid were aspirated. The fluid studies yielded\namylase 1825, lipase 3515, 30,000 RBC, 2200 WBC, NGTD.\n\nHe required ICU transfer on [**8-17**] for increasing shortness of\nbreath and desaturation to 80% on nasal cannula. While in the\nICU his respiratory status worsened and he required BIPAP, with\nongoing desaturations into the 70's and 80's off of BIPAP. He\nwas started on levaquin and treated for possible hospital\nacquired pneumonia vs. ARDS.\n\nOn [**8-18**], surgical consultation was obtained. On evaluation, he\ndid not complain of significant abdominal pain but did report\ndifficulty breathing.  At this point his WBC were 18, amylase\n194, lipase 29, TBili 1.1, other LFTs normal. His abdominal exam\nwas reported as benign. On [**8-19**] an ultrasound-guided\npercutaneous ascites catheter drainage procedure was performed.\nOn\nultrasound, they noted a loculated fluid collection surrounding\nthe spleen, as well as a focal well-circumscribed fluid\ncollection adjacent to the stomach. A pocket of free flowing\nfluid was noted in the right lower quadrant. An 8 French pigtail\ndrainage catheter was placed into the RLQ with return of dark\namber fluid.\n\nOn [**2114-8-23**], the previously yellow colored drainage from the\nascites drain was noted to be notably darker in color and fluid\nstudies yielded 460 RBC, 400 WBC, amylase 3338, lipase 8030,\nculture pending. Surgery was reconsulted for this change in\ndrain output and a reported increase in abdominal pain and a\nworsening\nabdominal exam. On evaluation at the OSH he was noted to have\nrebound tenderness and guarding and worsening respiratory status\nwith episodes of hypotension into the 70s. He was making good\nurine and remained afebrile without tachycardia. The patient was\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**] overnight on [**2114-8-24**] for further workup and\nmanagement.\n\nOn arrival, the patient was noted to be in respiratory distress\non BIPAP. His sats were in the low 90's on 100% FIO2. He stated\nthat his abdominal pain had been getting worse throughout the\nepigastrium and right lower quadrant.\n\n",

Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, with patchy\nconsolidation and\napical predominant interstitial thickening with superimposed\nground-glass\n(\"crazy paving\") pattern. Differential includes pulmonary\nhemorrhage and\nARDS, while infectious etiology is considered less likely.\n2. Pancreatic pseudocyst arising from the pancreatic tail,\nextending to\nengulf the spleen, which, though enhances normally, is\ncompressed and\ndistorted by the resultant mass effect. The splenic vessels are\npatent.\n3. Moderate free intraperitoneal fluid tracking into the pelvis,\nwith a right lower quadrant drainage catheter in situ.\n4. Slightly distended gallbladder with sludge in the gallbladder\nneck and\nprominent CBD, but without definitive wall thickening.\n5. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without diverticulitis.\n\n[**2114-9-17**] ABD CT:\nIMPRESSION: Large fluid collection in the left upper quadrant of\nthe abdomen with thin enhancing rim compatible with a pancreatic\npseudocyst. Since previous study there appears to be\nredistribution of this fluid with\ndecreasing component of fluid collection in the gastrosplenic\nligament and\nincreasing perisplenic fluid collection with extrinsic\ncompression upon the spleen.\n\n\n\n\nNeuro: The patient was sedated as long as he required ventilator\nsupport for ARDS. This was initially accomplished with propofol\nand fentanyl (til [**8-25**]) and later fentanyl and versed (til [**8-30**]).\nThe patient's level of sedation was decreased as he was weaned\noff of ventilator support as tolerated. On [**2114-8-30**], the patient\nappeared clinically improved and he was successfully extubated\nand taken off all forms of sedation. Following this, he appeared\nconfused and delirious. He was evaluated by psychiatry who\nrecommended initiation of antipsychotic and further treatment\nand evaluation following discharge. He was begun on Seroquel to\ngood effect, with no further episodes of auditory or visual\nhallucinations.  His pain was treated with oral medications once\nhe began tolerating PO, with occasional IV Dilaudid required for\nbreakthrough control. Currently tolerates PO Dilaudid, pain well\ncontrolled.\n\nCV: The patient required the use of low dose pressors, namely\nLevophed, and fluid boluses throughout his stay in the ICU\nsecondary to hypotension (SBPs in 70s-80s) and low urine output.\nMultiple attempts were made at weaning his pressor requirement,\nwithout success. On [**8-26**], the patient was noted to be\ntachycardic, hypotensive, and with low urine output. A Hct was\nchecked and found to be 25.5, and he was treated with 2 units of\nPRBCs with mild improvement in his symptoms. Mr. [**Known lastname **]\ncontinued to have borderline pressures, and given his continued\nneed for pressure support, a brief trial of steroids\n(hydrocortisone 100 TID) was attempted from [**Date range (1) 90666**] with\ngood effect. Mr. [**Known lastname 26971**] blood pressures improved and he was\nsuccessfully weaned off of Levophed. From this point forward,\nthe patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and\nrequired no further interventions. Given both this improvement,\nas well as his lack of further ventilatory support, Mr. [**Known lastname **]\nwas transferred to the floor on [**2114-9-3**]. Hisvital signs were\nroutinely monitored, and were noted to be stable throughout the\nremaineder of his hospitalization.\n\nPulmonary: At the time of admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to\nhave increased work of breathing, as well as increased\nsupplemental O2 requirement. A CT of his chest and abdomen was\nobtained and was notable for extensive bilateral pulmonary\nopacities suggestive of ARDS. Given this clinical picture and\nradiographic evidence, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was sedated and intubated, as\nwell as treated with IV antibiotics (Zosyn and vancomycin, per\nID recommendation) for presumed infection. He was maintained on\nmechanical ventilation until [**2114-8-30**] at which time the patient\nappeared clinically improved, with good O2 saturation of face\ntent alone and improvement of ARDS via CXR. Following this, the\npatient's pulmonary status remained stable. His vitals were\nroutinely monitored and he was instructed regarding the use of\nhis incentive spirometer.\n\nGI/GU/FEN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was nutritionally supported throughout his\nhospital stay firstly by TPN, and later by tube feeds given via\na Dobbhoff tube (initially placed on [**2114-8-29**], and again on\n[**2114-9-4**]). The patient tolerated tube without difficulty. His\ntube feeds were cycled overnight beginning on [**2114-9-4**], which he\ntolerated well. On [**2114-9-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 26971**] diet was advanced from\nsips to low-fat as tolerated. Despite tolerating regular food,\nhowever, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was unable to ingest adequate PO to maintain\nhis weight, and his tube feeds were continued. On [**2114-9-7**], the\npatient's abdominal pain increased significantly and his bloods\namylase level. Diet was changed to sips. The amylase and lipase\ncontinued to be above normal level. On [**2114-9-16**], patient\ndeveloped severe diarrhea and TF was held, and discontinued on\n[**2114-9-18**]. C-diff was negative x 3. On [**2114-9-18**], PICC line was\nplaced and patient was started on TPN. Dobbhoff was discontinued\nprior discharge. From a urinary standpoint, Mr. [**Known lastname 26971**]\nhospital course was notable for borderline [**Known lastname **] throughout his\nICU stay. He was treated with multiple fluid boluses while\nsimultaneously on pressors, and received one dose of albumin on\n[**2114-8-25**] with mild improvement. Mr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 26971**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] improved and\nremained adequate after receiving 2 units of PRBCs late on\n[**2114-8-25**]. Since this treatment, he experienced no further\nepisodes of oliguria.\n\nID: Mr [**Known lastname **] was initially treated with IV vancomycin and Zosyn\nupon arrival in the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU. At the time of admission, the\npatient was pan-cultured given his deteriorating clinical state.\nBlood cultures were negative initially and remained so\nthroughout Mr. [**Known lastname 26971**] hospitalization. Peritoneal fluid\ncultures obtained from the patient's ascites drain were also\nnegative for growth, with Gram Stain demonstrating only 1+ PMNs.\nGiven the patient's clinical state, and persistently elevated\nWBC count, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on antibiotic therapy with\nvancomycin and Zosyn until [**2114-9-5**]. Despite these treatments,\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be febrile to 101.6 and 100.1 on\n[**2114-9-1**]. He was pan-cultured at this time, with work-up\nrevealing yeast in the patient's urine. He was treated with\nseveral days of PO fluconazole to good effect. This was\ndiscontinued on [**2114-9-3**] with no further febrile episodes.\n\nEndocrine:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was placed on an insulin sliding scale.\nHis blood sugars were routinely monitored and he was treated\naccordingly. As noted above in the cardiovascular section, Mr.\n[**Known lastname **] was briefly treated with steroids given his inappropriate\nresponse to a stimulation test in the setting of hypotension and\ninability to be weaned from pressors. He was otherwise stable\nfrom an endocrine perspective, with normal laboratory values,\nthroughout his hospital stay and required no further treatment.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and\nvenodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get\nup and ambulate as early as possible.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stablevital signs.  The patient is ambulating, voiding\nwithout assistance, and pain was well controlled.  The patient\nreceived discharge teaching, education regarding warning signs,\nas well as explanation regarding plan of care and visiting nurse\nservices to be received while discharge home. His follow-up\nplans were explained to him and he verbally expressed\nunderstanding and agreement with them.\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital 84341**] [**Hospital **] Hospital\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n* Please resume all regular home medications , unless\nspecifically\nadvised not to take a particular medication.\n* Please take any new medications as prescribed.\n* Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times\nper day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids.\n* Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain\nmedications.\n* Please follow-up with your surgeon and Primary Care Provider\n(PCP) as advised.\nPlease call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you experience\nthe following:\n*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or\ntightness.\n*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.\n*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your\nmedications.\n*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea,\nor other reasons.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nMrs. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] admitted to the Trauma Surgery service after being\nhit by an automobile at approximately 35 miles an hour,\nsustaining the multiple injuries mentioned previously. She was\nintubated in the ED because of worsening mental status. Because\nof the active extravasation seen on CT, the patient was taken\nemergently to IR, however no active bleeder could be found\nrequiring intervention. Thus, the patient was brought to the\nICU.\n\nBy systems the rest of her stay can be summarized thus:\nNeurological: Because of her head injury, the patient was\nstarted on antiseizure medication with Keppra which was\ncontinued for 7 days as seizure prophylaxis. She did not have\nany seizures during her hospital stay. She remained intubated\nand sedated during her earlier hospitalization as well as after\nher maxillomandibular fixation on [**2129-4-3**] where she was nasally\nintubated. After extubation, her mental status improved and she\nwas clear and coherent, alert and oriented on discharge. She\nwill follow up with Cognitive Neurology as an outpatient.\n\nRespiratory: She was intubated at [**Hospital1 18**] for deteriorating mental\nstatus and protection of airway. After the OR on [**2129-4-3**], she\nremained nasally intubated until [**2129-4-8**]. This was due to the\nextreme swelling after her surgery, requiring treatment with\nsteroids to reduce swelling as well as diuresis. She underwent\nan uneventful extubation and remained stable respiratorily until\ndischarge.\n\nHeme: Upon admission, she went to IR for attempted embolization\nof the bleeding artery seen on CT. In the ICU, her hematocrit\ndrifted down over the course of days and she was transfused\nthree units in total during her stay. Her hematocrit stabilized\nat 20 and then began rising again prior to discharge. At\ndischarge she was hemodynamically normal, non-tachycardic and\nwithout orthostatic hypotension.\n\nOrtho/Mandible: On [**2129-4-3**], she underwent reduction and fixation\nof her mandible fracture with maxillomandibular fixation. She\nwas also seen by orthopaedics and treated nonoperatively for her\nvarious fractures. Because of concern for quadriceps tendon\nrupture, she had MRIs of her legs which showed no rupture. She\nis full weight bearing on the left and touch down weight bearing\non the right secondary to her right first toe proximal phalynx\nfracture.\n\nENT: She was seen by ENT upon presentation and just prior to\ndischarge for her Left temporal bone fracture and concern for a\nmiddle ear injury. She was given cipro ear drops. She will\nfollow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] for an outpatient audiogram and\nfollow up for the temporal bone fracture.\n\nNutrition: A dobhoff was placed at bedside for tube feeds on\n[**2129-4-3**] and this was used until she was extubated and able to\ntolerate thin liquid diet. Tube feeds were stopped two days\nprior to discharge. At discharge, she had adequate PO intake and\nwill go home with boost plus supplements in addition to a full\nliquid diet. The dobhoff was removed prior to discharge.\n\nOptho: because of blurry vision in her R eye, an opthalmology\n",

As a result the ICU placed him on\nMethadone [**Hospital1 **] for withdrawl prophylaxis. Pt had a repeat CT that\nevening which showed stable parafacline SDH and R frontal\ncontusions.\n\nHe was extubated without incident.  On [**7-31**], he was transferred\nto floor in stable condition.  Social work was consulted on [**8-1**]\ndue to active heroin abuse however patient refused to meet with\nsocial work.  He also refused the option of methadone clinic\ninitially stating that he wasn't allowed back to the\n[**Location (un) 89246**] clinic and subsequently stating that it\nwouldn't help his addiction.  It was explained to him that\nwithout adequate followup in methadone clinic or with a\nspecialist he would not be given a prescription for methadone.\nHe intitially entertained the option of a suboxone treatment\nprogram but then refused based on his HIV medication status.  He\nbecame increasingly agitated and demanded to be discharged as\nsoon as possible.\n\nAt the time of discharge the patient is afebrile, VSS, and\nneurologically stable.  Patient's pain is well-controlled and\nthe patient is tolerating a good oral diet.  He was cleared by\nPT for discharge home in stable condition and will follow-up\naccordingly.\n\n",

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nSUMMARY\n\nMs. [**Known lastname 101629**] had a long course. Initially admitted with hypoNA and\nhypoK, she went on to develop severe fluid overload requiring\nintubation and CRRT as well as a UTI and presumptive PNA treated\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics. Her fluid overload was\ncomplicated by SVT that prompted initiation of selective beta\nblockade and a cardiac evaluation (negative nuclear stress). She\nwent on to tolerate aggressive diuresis and was discharged\n\nBy Problem\n\n# Hyponatremia [**1-20**] to Cirrhotic hemodynamics, fluid overload\n  Hypotension, Shock with septic physiology\n\n  On admission, Na+ was 120 and she was asymptomatic. Initially\ntreated with fluid restriction with little success, then with\nTolvaptan 15mg then 30mg with increases of [**12-20**] mEq per day,\nplateauing at 126.  On [**7-28**] She was hypotensive to the 90's with\northostasis.  She was transferred to the [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery team\nand SICU on [**7-30**] for dyspnea and hemodynamic management. her\nrespiratory status declined to the point of requiring intubation\n(see respiratory failure). She required the support of 2\npressors. Despite no clear  source of her septic response, with\nsupportive care and antibiotic treatment, the patient's\nhemodynamics and respirtory systems stabilized. On [**8-4**],\nCeftriaxone, vanco, and flagyl due to her hypotension and\nworsening leukocytosis. On [**8-5**] fluc was started.  There was not\na clear source of the patient's hypotension and leukocytosis.\nOn [**8-12**], antibiotics were stopped. The patient was then\ntransferred back to the floor in stable condition.\n\n# Respiratory Failure [**1-20**] fluid overload\n  Hepatic Hydrothorax\n  Oliguric renal failure\n\n  On admission [**2167-7-21**] she was short of breath, but saturating\nwell 95-98% on room air.  She became breathless with 5-7 word\nsentences.  A paracentesis removed one liter of fluid on [**7-25**],\nwithout much resolution of symptoms, an ultrasounds on [**7-27**] found\ninsufficient ascites to tap. Thoracetesis on [**7-29**], removed 900cc\nof pleural transudative fluid. CXR on [**7-29**] for SOB found\npulmonary edema with sats 90-92%.  After albumin/lasix/albuterol\nsats improved to 94-96% on 3L NC and creatinine rose to 1.4.\nHer saturations were at 90-92% sitting, and on standing her sats\ndropped to 85%. She was transferred to the ICU where she\nrequired intubation and CRRT. On [**8-4**], the patient failed BiPAP\nand was intubated. Bronch on [**8-6**] showed minimal secretions.  As\nmore fluid was removed and her hypotension improved, the patient\nwas weaned to PS from CMV.  On [**8-13**], the patient was extubated.\nOn [**8-8**], the patient tolerated being 2.6L negative on CVVHD\nalong with BP support on pressors.  The patient tolerated having\n2L removed daily.  By [**8-12**], the CVVHD was running even. On [**8-14**],\nCVVHD was stopped the patient's urine output slowly increased.\nUpon return to the floor, she tolerated aggressive diuresis with\nmidodrine for BP support.\n\n# Atrial Fibrillation\n  Patent Forament Ovale\n  Normal EF, Normal Nuclear Stress\n\n  On SICU admission, the patient had a stable blood pressure.\nOn [**8-1**], the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid\nresponse. Cardiology was consulted and recommended continued\ndiuresis and to add metoprolol 12.5 PO BID for rate control.  On\n[**7-31**] an echo cardiogram (TTE and TEE) was performed which showed\nnormal systolic function and a PFO. Cardiac enzymes were\nnegative x 3.  The patient went into intermittent A. fib. On\n[**8-3**], the patient was started on low dose dopamine with no\ncardiovascular or renal response. On [**8-4**], Neo-synephrine was\nstarted and the lopressor was d/c'ed. Vasporessin was also\nstarted for hypotension. Due to presumed sepsis, the\nNeo-synephrine was transitioned to levophed.  Pressors were\nweaned over the next few days. The patient received intermittent\nIV and PO lopressor for bouts of A. fib. On the floor, she was\nmaintained on 12.5 mg Metop tartrate TID. A nuclear stress was\nnegative, save for persantine induced symptoms. Cardiology\nrecommends continuing beta blockade through her [**Month/Year (2) **]\n\n# Hypokalemia\n\n  She was repleted with KCl and her potassium corrected and was\nstable for the remainder of the admission.\n\n# Cirrhosis, likely from NASH (T2DM, hx of obesity, htn,\ndyslipidemia)\n\n  The patient was continued on tube feeds (isosource 1.5). She\nwas continued on lactulose and ursodiol, gastric varices, and\nascites.\n\n# T2DM\n\n  The patient is on an regular insulin SS for her DMII. In the\nICU, on [**8-7**], an insulin gtt was started to improved glucose\ncontrol.  The insulin gtt was weaned and the patient was started\non NPH and sliding scale which she tolerated well.\n\n# UTI\n\n  The patient was on ciprofloxacin for a klebsiella UTI.   The\npatient was then started on daily ciprofloxacin for SBP\nprophylaxis.\n\n\n",

There\nwere no significant ST segment changes noted with the infusion;\nhowever, this was in the setting of development of LBBB during\nthe infusion which returned back to baseline by the end of\nrecovery period. The rhythm was sinus with rare APBs and one\natrial couplet. There was an appropriate hemodynamic response to\nPersantine. At 1.5 minutes post infusion, 125mg of IV\nAminophylline was given to reverse the Persantine side effects.\n\nIMPRESSION: Probable Persantine-induced symptoms as outlined. No\nsignificant ST segment changes noted but, in the setting of the\ndevelopment of LBBB/IVCD during the Persantine infusion, is\nprobably\nuninterpetable for ischemia.\n\nNuclear Report: No myocardial perfusion defects.

The patient was taken to\nthe operating room on [**10-5**]; the mediastinoscopy was complicated\nby significant scarring (probably from infiltrative tumorous\nprocess) in pretracheal space with a subsequent tear in the\ninominate Artery requiring emergent sternotomy with primary\nrepair.  Fortuantely, the patient remained hemodynamically\nstable throughout the operation with SBP consistently above 100;\nhe did have EBL 1000, u/o 220, ivf 2500, 5 units of blood were\ntransfused.\n\nPostoperatively the patient was taken to the SICU and extubated\nwhere he remained in good condition overnight.  His Hct remained\nstable at 28.\n\n# Rapid Atrial Fibrillation:\nOn POD2 the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation.  He was\nplaced on a diltiazem drip and converted to sinus rhythm\novernight.  The following day his drip was discontinued, he was\nplaced back on his home dose of atenolol and started on lasix.\nThe evening of POD3 he converted back to atrial fibrillation\nwith regular ventricular rate. He was changed to lopressor and\ndiltiazem with rate control.\nCardiology was consulted, who recommended lopressor TID and an\nEchocardiogram.  The Echo revealed:  EF 55% with normal left\nventricular function. (see report).\n\n# Right sided effusion\nThe patient was brought to the SICU with a mediastinal [**Doctor Last Name **] in\nplace; this was discontinued on POD2.  On POD4 the patient was\nnoted to have a developing right sided effusion.  IP was\nconsulted for thoracentesis.  They drained 340 ml of bloody\ndischarge.\n\n# NSCLCA\nUnfortunately, the mediastinal lymph nodes were positive for\nmetastatic disease. He was schedule for follow-up with the\nmultidisciplinary onocology team as an outpatient.\n\n\n",

His weight loss and anorexia are complicated\nby the history of hiatal hernia.  Our recent CT evidence showed\nparaesophageal hernia which patient underwent an UGI EGD.  The\nGI team did not observed a significant obstruction during this\ntest.  Barium swallow, however, did show some signs of slow\npassage at this juncture.  He had a complete infectious workup\nwith echo and CT of head for possible other source of\ndisseminated fungal infection.  ID was consulted and felt that\nthere were no infectious etiology to explain the course of FTT.\nHe had Geriatric, GI and Psychiatry evaluation.  Per Geriatric\nrecommendations, we have started him on Ritalin and titrate up\nto 5mg QAm and 2.5 mg Qnoon.\n.\nHe was to go for planned surgical repair of hiatal hernia on\n[**12-15**], unfortunately, this was put on hold due to CONS infection\nlikely from the PICC.  He was transferred to the MICU for closer\nmonitoring.  He received broad spectrum coverage initially.\nPICC line was removed and cultured.  He was then narrowed to\nvancomycin (completed 2 week course) and IV fluconazole.  After\na two day stay, he was transferred to the floor with signs of\nfluid overload due to IVF resuscitation.\n.\nOn floor, he maintained largely stable.  He underwent PEG\nplacement and hiatal hernia repair on [**2190-12-22**].  He did well.\n.\n# Vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, h/o psoas abscesses- Per ID,\nrestart fluconazole given normal LFTs. There were improved fluid\ncollections on CT, with no evidence of para-spinal fluid\ncollection. ESR would suggest ongoing infection, although CRP is\nimproved.  He was continued on fluconazole 400mg IV daily during\nthe hospitalization.\n.\n# [**Last Name (un) **]- Fe Na 1.3% though still suspect pre-renal physiology;\nhowever, given recent antifungal and antibiotic, could be due to\nATN.  There were no evidence of hydronephrosis on CT, with\ndecompressed bladder. No evidence of UTI.  His renal function\nimproved with aggressive IVF.  He was not able to take in PO to\nkeep up with his output.\n.\n# h/o Deep Venous Thrombosis: Noted IVC clot on CT, with\nnon-occluded IVC filter.  His Warfarin was restarted on [**2190-12-24**]\nhe was given 1 mg, 3 mg on [**12-25**] (INR 1.4), 26 (INR 1.5)& 27\n(INR 1.9). INR on [**12-28**] 2.4 decreased dose to 1 mg daily.\n.\n# AAA s/p EVAR- stable. continued anti-hypertensive meds, ASA,\nstatin.\n.\n# h/o hiatal hernia- continued PPI, Barium swallow showed\nquestionable slowing of passage at the hernia, EGD was negative\nfor any obstructive symptoms.  He is not a surgical candidate\ncurrently.\n.\n# Anemia of Chronic Disease: On recent labs, normocytic\nnormochromic with high RDW and with low iron, low TIBC, iron sat\n27% all indicate anemia of chronic disease superimposed with\ncomponent of iron deficiency.

To further evaluate the\nduodenal stricture, a CT torso with contrast was performed.\nGiven her CKD stage [**Name (NI) 1105**], pt received pre-contrast hydration\nprotocol with sodium bicarbonate to minimize the risk of\ncontrast-induced nephropathy. Unfortunately, the CT scan showed\nsignificant evidence of malignancy, with \"extensive soft-tissue\nmass involving the greater omentum. In addition, new hepatic\nlesions, ascites, and colonic serosal lesion are worrisome for\nperitoneal metastases from breast or ovarian cancer.\"\nInterestingly, the etiology of the duodenal stricture was not\nidentified on imaging. IR was consulted for biopsy of the\nomental-mass, and she underwent CT-guided biopsy on [**7-5**].\nPathology showed infiltrating adenocarcinoma. Special stains\nshowed a primary tumor either from the breast, ovary, uterus or\nupper GI tract.  The Oncology team at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted and\nthey requested an MRI brain, which was negative and a\ntransvaginal US which showed multiple cystic lesions in the left\nadnexa.  Oncology also recomended a Gyn/Onc c/s for possible\nsurgical mangement. The patient had ongoing difficulty\ntolerating po's and a repeat EGD was done which did not show a\nstentable lesion.  For further targeting of a lesion, a GI\nfollow through was done which showed a partial high grade\nobstruction in the third portion of the duodenum. In the setting\nof elevated CA 125, an pelvic u/s revealing a ovarian mass and a\npathological finding of adenocarcinoma, a diagnosis of\nmetastatic ovarian CA was made. The patient had a G tube placed\non [**2143-7-18**] that relieved her symptoms of obstruction.\nThe initial attempt at placing a J-tube was unsuccessful and a\nrepeat attempt was performed on [**2143-7-22**], with a repeat attempt on\n[**2143-8-1**], also unsuccessful.  Patient continued to deteriorate\nand by [**2143-8-4**], the family, patient and health care proxy agreed\nthat comfort measures only would be pursued going forward.  By\nthe afternoon, her antibiotics, maintenence fluids, and TPN were\nwithdrawn, as were most of her non-essential medications.  Her\ncomfort was maintained and she passed at 2300 on the night of\n[**2143-8-4**].\n.\n# Aspiration pneumonia: became evident when she developed acute\nhypoxia, tachypnea, and cough on [**7-5**]. CXR showed new RML and\nRLL infiltrates, and she was started on levofloxacin.  Her WBC\nwas persistently elevated and her coverage was changed to\nvanco/CTX and flagyl which she continued for 10 days. She\nclinically improved with antibiotics and albuterol nebulizers.\nShe completed the treatment and has since then been stable on 3L\nNC O2.  She was noted to be rhonchorous and has had difficulty\ngenerating sufficient expiratory forces to help remove some of\nthe secretions.  With chest PT and time, this has steadily\nimproved. She has a history of Radiation-induced fibrosis,\nrestrictive lung disease, and persistent R pleural effusions\nwhich all lend to a poor respiratory reserve.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: went into spontaneous afibrillation on\nthe floor.  She was tachypneic, but her blood pressure was\nholding. [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] housestaff was called to evaluated the patient.\nShe was given Dilt (out of concern that beta blockade would\nworsen her respiratory status), ABG was performed but revealed a\nvenous gas. Given the fact that her tachycardia was refactory to\nIV dilt, after receiving additional 90 of PO Dilt she was\ntransferred to the unit for further management.  The afib was\nattributed to recent aspiration event and was managed with\nmetoprolol and diltiazem. Her medications were continued in the\nICU and as pt's respiratory status and overall clinical status\nimproved, pt re-entered sinus rhythm and was no longer\ntachycardic.\n\n# Pleural effusions\nLikley due to structural lung disease with overlying infection.\nThe left pleural effusion was tapped (drained 800cc initially)\nby the ICU team on [**7-9**] with some releif of her symptoms.  Her\npleural fluid was negative for malignancy and was transudative\naccording to Light's criteria and did not grow any\nmicroorganisms.\n\n# Acute On Chronic kidney disease, stage 4: Etiology unclear.\nCreatinine peak was 1.9 during this hospitalization and later\ndowntrended to 1.3 before bumping back up to 1.9.\n\n# AF with RVR: The patient experienced AF with RVR while in the\nICU which was treated with B-blockers and calcium channel\nblockers. Pt was in normal sinus rhythm, not tachycardic when\ntransferred to the floor.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: recent TSH at [**Hospital1 112**]. Stable on levothyroxine.\n\n# HTN: stable, continued Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY\n\n# depression: stable, continued sertraline 100 mg PO DAILY\n\n# Symptomatic hypocalcemia: Evaluation led to diagnosis of\nprobable hypoparathyroidism (CONFIRM)based on her prior thyroid\nsurgery for thyroid cancer.  According to information from OSH,\nthe patient has some residual parathryodi tissues???\nEndocrinology was consulted while in the ICU for syptomatic\nhypocalcemia and she received IV and oral repletion with Vit D\nand CaCO3.\n\n# Venous access: Obtaining a good venous access has been a\nsubstantial challenge given poor peripheral veins.  A right PICC\nline was attempted under IR but the IR team could not advance to\nthe SVC (likely due to past XRT/lymphadectomy).  A midline was\nplaced instead.  The midline was difficult\n.\n#Goals of Care/Code status:\nA goals of care meeting was conducted with the patient and a\nfriend where it was shared with the patient that she had a\nguarded prognosis given her metastatic cancer.  Quality of life\nwas discussed and the patient voiced her preference to continue\nto pursue diagnostic tests and discuss treatment options.  At\nthe same time, she was interested in meeting with the Palliative\nCare Physicians to discuss options.  This information was also\nshared with the patients sister in a separate meeting.  The\npatients decided to make herself DNR/DNI.  Discussion while in\nthe ICU revealed pt's wish to be DNR but ok to intubate for\n\"short periods.\" During her last week it was unclear if pt\nunderstood meaning of hospice.\n\n\n",

He was initially given 2 units pRBCs\nand 1 L IVF with improvement in hemodynamics.  Patient with\nevidence of active end organ ischemia given troponin elevation,\nST changes on EKG, and elevated lactate. Patient received a\ntotal of 8 units pRBC as well as one FFP and platelet\ntransfusion. GI saw the patient and performed an endoscopy\ntwice. The first did not provide adequate visualization due to\nsignificant bleeding. The second endoscopy visualized vascular\nlesion consistent with Dieulafoy lesion and was clipped. Post\nprocedure the patient remained hemodynamically stable with\nstable Hct and did not require any further transfusions. His\nhematocrit remained stable on the floor and his PPI was\ntransitioned from IV to PO.  He had a repeat endoscopy on day of\ndischarge that showed barretts. Biopsies were taken. He is to\nhave repeat EGD in [**6-21**] weeks.\n\n.\n# Myocardial ischemia: Patient with likely demand ischemia in\nsetting of GIB, without chest pain.  Patient with troponin\nelevation during prior hospitalization in the setting of renal\nfailure. A repeat TTE was performed and compared with the\nfindings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-11-30**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced\nsecondary to more extensive inferior and posterior wall\ndysfunction. Atrius Cardiology evaluated the patient. Beta\nblocker was initially held during acute GI bleed, but then\nrestarted once he was stable. His heart rhythm was stable with\noccasional 2nd degree block similar to his previous\nhospitalization.  His ASA was not restarted and will need to be\nrestarted at the discretion of his PCP/cardiologist. He was\nrestarted on his home doses of lisinopril and HCTZ. He was\nrestarted on his 50mg Metoprolol succinate. He will follow up\nwith atrius cardiology.\n.\n# Lyme carditis/AV Block: Patient presented to an OSH with\nnew-onset high-grade AV block with a narrow complex junctional\nescape rhythm. Patient is currently undergoing empiric treatment\nfor Lyme disease given history of tick exposures.  Initial Lyme\nserologies were negative so they were repeated and were still\nnegative. He was continued on ceftriaxone for a project 21-day\ncourse to end on [**2124-12-20**].  Cardiology did not feel that a pacer\nwas indicated at this time given his improvement on treatment.\n.\n# Hyperkalemia: Unclear etiology, improved in ED following\nadministration of calcium, bicarb, insulin.  Most likely\nsecondary to CKD. Potassium normalized and was WNL at the time\nof transfer to the floor and remained stable.\n.\n# CHF: TTE with EF of 45% during this hospitalization with\nhistory of EF of 40% from prior TTE. Repeat TTE as above.\n.\n# CKD: Creatinine increased from baseline of 2.0.  Possibly in\nthe setting of poor perfusion in the setting of hemorrhage.\nPatient's Cr remained elevated at the time of his transfer and\nslowly trended back toward his baseline.\n.\n# Leukocytosis: Baseline elevated WBCs.

Patient was\ndischarged from cardiology service on [**2124-12-3**] following\nadmission for dyspnea, found to have a new heart block, elevated\ntroponin, and ST changes on EKG.  There was concern that his\nnew-onset AV block was secondary to lyme disease and patient was\ndischarged home on ceftriaxone.  He was also restarted on\naspirin during that admission.\n.\nTonight the patient started having dyspnea while at home at\nrest.  Pt denies chest pain, but complains of nausea, [**2-17**]\nepisodes of non-bloody emesis, which looked dark brown.  He got\nup to go to the bathroom, felt lightheaded, and fell.  He did\nnot hit his head or lose consciousness.  Pt endorses dark stool,\nbut has noticed this since starting iron.  Pt denies fever,\ncough, abdominal pain.\n.\nIn the ED, initial VS were: 97.3 96 98/50 16 96% RA.

EKG was significant for\nsinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 111550**] elevations in II, III, aVF and\nTWI in I and aVL, which was felt consistent with prior.  Two 18\ngauge IVs were placed.  Patient was transfused 2 units pRBCs (4\nadditional units crossmatched). NG lavage with marroon return,\ndid not clear.  Patient was given protonix bolus with gtt.  For\nhis potassium of 6.4, patient received calcium chloride, insulin\nand D50, albuterol, 1 amp sodium bicarb.\n.\nWhile in the emergency department, patient was noted to have\nworsening dyspnea and on telemetry he became more bradycardiac\nto the 40s.  He had three to four of these epidoses, each\nlasting approximately one minute.  Patient's heart rate improved\nspontaneously, he did not require any atropine.  On transfer,\npatient was in sinus tach at 110 with SBP of 130.\n.\nOn arrival to the MICU, patient feels comfortable, but endorses\nsome intermittent dyspnea. No chest pain.

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is moderately\ndepressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and\nposterior walls. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right\nventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular\nchamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility.\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a\nminimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic\nvalve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial\neffusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\nCompared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)\nof [**2124-11-30**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is\nfurther reduced secondary to more extensive inferior and\nposterior wall dysfunction.\n\nCXR:\nWith the chin elevated, the tip of the endotracheal tube is at\nthe upper\nmargin of the clavicles, no less than 6 cm from the carina,\nprobably an\nacceptable position.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nIn summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 2769**] is a 43-year-old male with a longstanding\nhistory of HIV/AIDs who was admitted with a CD4 count of 16 and\n1 week of worsening fevers, cough and dyspnea and found to have\nsputum samples and imaging consistent with an acute PCP\npneumonia episode.\n.\n# Hypoxemia/Dyspnea: The patient explains feeling very fatigued\nwith nightly fevers in the 101-103 range for 1 week leading up\nto his hospital admission. He began having chest \"tightness\" and\nprogressive shortness of breath about 3 days prior to ED\npresentation. The day of admission he had an acute worsening of\nhis shortness of breath and hypoxia which prompted his transfer\nto the MICU. This was most likely related to underlying PCP\nalongside acute bronchospasm from sputum induction given the\ntemporality of his symptoms which occured shortly after an\ninduced sputum sample was collected. He responded very well to\nalbuterol nebulizer therapy and fortunately, never required\nintubation. To protect against possible inflammatory response\nfrom anti-PCP treatment steroids were initiated and\nappropriately increased from 40 daily to 40 [**Hospital1 **]. [**Hospital1 2768**] was\nagain tapered after 4-5 days down to qdaily dosing. He was\ncontinued on Pentamidine 225 IV daily in place of Bactrim given\nhis allergy to sulfa medications. Later in his hospital course\nhe was transitioned to 300mg PO Trimethoprim three times daily\nalong with 100mg daily Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. He was continued\non albuterol nebulizers as needed for the remainder of his\nhospital course and he was continued on supportive oxygen via\nnasal cannula with oxygen saturation goal of >95%. He was\ngradually weaned down from 4-5L/min to 2L oxygen on nasal\ncannula by the time of discharge. Mr. [**Known lastname 2770**] desaturations\nwere clearly most marked with any exertion. Walking oxygen\nsaturation levels improved very slowly but he was still dropping\nto 88-90% after only [**10-31**] yards of ambulation 1-2 days prior to\ndischarge. Therefore, he was set up with home oxygen\ntherapy/continuous flow at 2L to use at home while he continued\nto recuperate.  He was set up for close follow-up with his PCP,\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2114-12-24**].\n.\n\n# Pneumocystis jirovecii/ PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: The patient had a\nsputum sample done [**2114-12-11**] which was positive for Pneumocystis\njirovecii. Moreover, the patient's CXR and CT revealed bilateral\ninfiltrates consistent with the diagnosis and he also had a\ntypical LDH elevation to further corroborate the diagnosis. Mr.\n[**Known lastname 2770**] fevers, shortness of breath/hypoxia, and recent cough\nwere all [**Known lastname 2771**] to his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was more prone to infection\nwith a low CD4 count of 16 and his worsening immunocompromised\nstate was likely directly linked to his HAART medication\nnon-compliance over the last 6 months. As above, he was\ncontinued on albuterol nebulizers PRN along with Pentamidine and\nthen TMP/Dapsone combination for treatment of his PCP.\n[**Name10 (NameIs) 2768**] was eventually tapered from 40mg b.i.d. to 40mg once\ndaily for 5 days with a plan to then taper to 20mg daily for 10\ndays. He was continued on low flow supplemental oxygen via nasal\ncannula and weaned down to 2L by time of discharge. Mr. [**Known lastname 2770**]\nshortness of breath and cough gradually improved throughout his\nhospital course. Lung exam at time of discharge revealed much\nless prominent diffuse rhonchi than his admission presentation.\nHe also appeared less fatigued and was breathing much more\ncomfortably in lower O2 requirements.\n.\n#Diarrhea: Given immunocompromised state with CD4 count of 16\nother infectious etiologies were considered with a wide\ndifferential. Mr. [**Known lastname 2770**] recent fevers up to 103 degrees were\nlikely from his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2772**], given his noncompliance with his\nHIV therapy for 6 months, the team opted to collect multiple\nstool studies. Per OMR records, he had been seen in [**2112**]-[**2113**]\nfor chronic diarrhea and dyspeptic symptoms and he has a past\nhistory of ulcers in the upper third of his esophagus. Biopsies\nback in [**2109**] were negative for HSV and CMV. On this admission he\nhad an extensive workup for his diarrhea and stool studies\ntested negative for all ova/parasites, cryptospora,\nmicrosporidium, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and\ngiardia. Viral stool studies and C.difficile studies were also\nnegative. Mr. [**Known lastname 2769**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2771**] his 25lb weight loss over the\npast 5 months to his intermittent chronic diarrhea ([**3-21**]\nepisodes/week) and decreased appetite. As of [**12-2**] his\ndiarrhea symptoms tapered and he proceeded to have 2 days of\nconstipation which was relieved with some stool softeners. By\nthe time of discharge he had been having normal, daily, well\nformed bowel movements for 3 days and his diarrhea appeared to\nhave at least temporarily ceased. During the initial days of his\nhospital stay he was given some supplemental IVFs as needed, but\nhe continued to have excellent PO fluid intake so IVFs weren't\nneeded. He was encouraged to follow up with his PCP as an\noutpatient if his diarrhea returned for possible imaging and\nadditional workup.\n.\n# HIV/AIDS: Mr. [**Known lastname 2770**]  CD4 count of 16 was largely a result\nof his noncompliance with HAART medications x 6 months. After\nadmission he was restarted on ritonavir, atazanavir, and\ntruvada. He had complaints of dysphagia with his ritonavir\ntablet and he was switched to the elixir form which he was able\nto tolerate much better. He was continued on this same regimen\nat time of his discharge. He was also continued on [**Doctor First Name **]\nprophylaxis with Azithromycin and PCP treatment with\nTrimethoprim/Dapsone daily with a plan for 21 days total\ntherapy.\n.\n# Weight loss: The patient reports a 25lb weight loss over the\npast 4-5 months. This is likely multifactorial in origin\nincluding diarrhea, infection, and noncompliance with his AIDS\nmedications. Stool studies were all unremarkable and he had no\nevidence of GI bleeding. He was encouraged to consider\nsupplemental shakes at time of discharge. He will continue to\nmonitor his weight loss with his primary care physician as an\noutpatient.\n.\n#Transaminitis: Mr. [**Known lastname 2769**] had a slight increase in his AST /ALT\nenzymes which were [**Known lastname 2771**] to restarting his HAART regimen in\nconjunction with his TMP therapy. Dapsone can also raise LFTs.\nALT peaked at 104 and AST reached a high of 55. He had no\nevidence of hepatosplenomegaly or RUQ tenderness on physical\nexam. No abdominal pain or jaundice. ALP remained within normal\nlimits.  He will continue to have this issue followed as an\noutpatient.\n.\n# Dysphagia: On exam, the patient had yellowish patches on the\nposterior aspect of tongue consistent with thrush. His dysphagia\ngradually improved with a combination of oral fluconazole\ntherapy and daily nystatin swish and swallow for suspected\n[**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis. CMV esophagitis and HSV were also on the\ndifferential, especially since the patient has a known history\nof CMV esophagitis. After rapid response to fluconazole it was\nclear that he had a fungal infection. By time of discharge he\nhad scant patches and near complete resolution of his symptoms.\nHe was asked to continue his Diflucan and Nystatin for a total\nof 2 weeks.\n.\n\n# Anemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 2769**] had no sudden hematocrit drops or any\nevidence of acute bleeding during his hospital course. Based on\nhis high ferritin and low TIBC his anemia is mainly from chronic\ndisease. Iron levels were WNL and he had a borderline MCV at 80.\nFolate and Vitamin B12 deficiency were considered but follow-up\nlab testing revealed both Vitamin B12/folic acid levels were\nwithin normal limits.\n.\n#Hyperkalemia: A few days into his hospital stay he had a slight\nelevation from K 5 to 5.3 which was most likely a side effect of\nhis trimethoprim therapy which can raise potassium levels. He\nwas given Kayexalate 30g x1 on [**12-16**] and patient had 2 loose BMs\nwith a drop in his K down from 5 to 4 range. EKGs were all\nunremarkable and he had no repeat hyperkalemia bouts.\n.\n# Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Electrolytes were\nmonitored and repleted daily as needed. He was continued on a\nregular PO diet with nutritional supplements and additional\nhydration with IVFs as needed.\n.\n# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin was given for DVT\nprevention, and H2 blocker was provided for GI protection. Bowel\nregimen was given for a few days later in his hospital stay for\na few days of constipation.\n.\nThe patient was maintained as a full code status for the\nentirety of his hospital stay and communication occurred on a\ndaily basis directly with the patient to update him on his\nhealth status and progress. He was set up for close follow-up\nwith his primary care physician at the time of discharge.\n.\n\n\n",

            "History of Present Illness": "History of Present Illness:\nThe paitent is a 43-year-old male with a longstanding history of\nHIV/AIDS who presented to the ED after a week long history of\nhigh grade fevers and worseing dyspnea with exertion. The\npatient was diagnosed in [**2095**] with HIV and has been on and off\nHAART therapy since that time. Most recently, he was on steady\ntreatment for 3 years until this spring when he decided to take\na self decided medication holiday. He reports he has not taken\nHAART medications in about 6 months. About 2-3 months ago the\npatient also started having watery diarrhea intermittently [**2-18**]\ntimes weekly. About one and a half weeks ago, he started\nnoticing high fevers and night sweats. The diarrhea worsened and\ninstead of having it on and off, it became constant. The fevers\nalso continued to worsen and peaked at a temp of 103.6 today,\nthe morning of his admission. Two days prior to admission he\nstarted noticing shortness of breath with simple tasks such s\nclimbing a few stairs at home. He also describes a\nnon-productive dry cough and some chest \"tightness\" associated\nwith this increased work of breathing. He could barely walk from\nthe kitchen back and forth to the couch due to his dyspnea. He\nhas also noticed daily headaches. He denies neck\nstiffness/rigidity, photophobia or any new skin rashes. He\ndescribes some mild blurry vision when he would try to focus on\n[**Location (un) 1131**] but this would subside after a minute or so. He now\ncomplains of diffuse weakness and lightheadedness today. He\ndenies any syncope. Of note, he has lost about 25 pounds over\nthe last couple months which he attributes to a decreased\nappetite and his diarrhea issues.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vitals were T 99.4, BP 97/56, P 98, R 22, 85%\non RA with only a slight improvement to 91% on 2L. The patient\nreceived 1000 mg IV  Vancomycin, 750 mg PO Levofloxacin, and 40\nmg oral [**Location (un) 2768**]. He was ordered for Pentamidine 225 mg but\ndid not receive it in the ED. An ABG was done and showed a low\npO2 of 72. CXR showed multiple small patchy opacities\nbilaterally which were immediately concerning for PCP.\n.\nOn the floor, the patient continued to feel short of breath. He\nwas eventually comfortable on [**4-21**] L NC O2 but noticed he got\nvery winded walking to and from the bathroom. He denied any\nnausea, vomiting. No abdominal pain. No diarrhea on day of\nadmission. He still felt weak \"all over\" and had diffuse muscle\naches. No headaches on arrival to floor. The patient had an\nacute exacerbation of his shortness of breath with associated\ntachypnea and tachycardia soon after admission to the medical\nfloor. This acute episode of respiratory distress was soon after\nan induced sputum sample and thus, likely due to associated\nbronchospasms. The patient was hypoxic on labs and was therefore\ntransferred to the MICU for a brief one day stay in order to\nwatch his airway closely while he improved. Fortunately, he\nimproved significantly following nebulizer treatments and high\nflow supplemental oxygen. He did not require any intubations. He\nwas transferred back to the general medical floor once he was\nmore hemodynamically stable and breathing comfortably on 4L\noxygen via nasal cannula with oxygen saturations >95%\nconsistently.\n\n\n",

However, on work-up of her delirium she was found\nto have a UTI that had intermediate resistance to Unasyn, so her\nantibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone and metronidazole and\nlater cefpodoxime and metronidazole. She received a total of 10\ndays of antibiotics.\n\n# Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: Patient was noted to have\nhyperactive delirium following her ERCP, most likely in the\nsetting of infection. She was treated with ampicillin/sulbactam\nfor presumed cholangitis. She was given intravenous fluids for\nhydration, re-oriented frequently, and sensory environment was\noptimized. Patient required intermittent doses of haloperidol\nfor agitation. She continued to have delirium and was\ntransferred to the medicine service for further management. Work\nup was positive for UTI, constipation and vitamin B12\ndeficiency. She was treated for all 3, but her symptoms did not\nimprove. Initially she was not responsive to zyprexa during\nperiods of agitation, so seroquel and trazadone were started\nQHS. She had two episodes of unresponsiveness after the first\nnight (details described below), so these medications were\ndiscontinued. Her mental status continued to wax and wane during\nadmission, however, patient became more calm and less\nhyperactive overall and was not on any psychoactive medications\nat discharge. It is unclear what her baseline was prior to\nadmission, however, it is likely that she had baseline dementia\ngiven her current mental status.\n\n# Unresponsiveness: Patient had an episode of unresponsiveness\non [**2193-5-30**].  She was doing well early during pre-rounds and then\naround 10:30am she became more somnolent and was not responsive\nto sternal rub; only responded to nail bed pressure.

She was\nsensitive to movements and retracted when her legs were flexed.\nShe developed some rhythmic movements of her lower extremities.\nThere was no bowel or bladder incontinence. It was thought that\nmaybe this was a delayed reaction to the seroquel 12.5mg and\ntrazadone 25mg PO that she had received the previous night.\nThere was also concern for a seizure. She recovered from this\nepisode after 1.5 hours and then was back in her baseline\ndelirious state. This occurred again later that afternoon. Stat\nEEG was ordered and Neurology was consulted. After the second\nevent, there was increased concern for siezure, however, EEG did\nnot reveal seizure activity and neurology did not think that\nthis was consistent with seizure. All psychotropic medications\nwere discontinued. These episodes did not recur.\n\n# Urinary tract infection: Patient was found to have a urinary\ntract infection, which likely contributed to her delirium. She\nwas treated with a 7-day course of cefpodoxime.\n\n# Ingrown toenail: Patient had ingrown left hallux that was\ntrimmed by podiatry. No evidence of infection.\n\n# Guardianship: During this admission, patient's granddaughter,\n[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 174**], was named her temporary guardian.\n\n# DVT Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this\nadmission.\n\n# Code status: Full code.

Hypotension was thought to be\nrelated to A. fib with RVR with rates ranging from 110-120s. Pt\nreceived a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still\nnoted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Differential\nincluded A. fib with RVR given his prior history, however would\nexpect a more impressive rate to give such hypotension. Other\ndifferentials to consider included possible sepsis that could\nhave occured peri-op, he was also noted to have leukocytosis\nprior to his operation. On review of his record he has had\nseptic shock after GU procedures as well as a history of VRE,\npan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP also noted to decrease after\nDiltiazem 120mg was given. For possible sepsis patient was\nbolused with 500cc LR to check BP response, pt mentating well\ncurrently. Changed antiobiotics of Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Zosyn\n(for broad Gram positive, negative coverage) and Linezolid (VRE\ncoverage). Pt received Diltiazem and is on Morphine PCA which\ncould also explain the hypotension.  Blood cultures were sent.\nAntibiotics were then discontinued on post-op day 2 per Urology,\ngiven no evidence of infection, and resolution of hypotension.\n.\n##. A. fib with RVR:  Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op\nfollowing a prior GU surgery performed in [**2127**]. On review of\nanaesthesia records it appears his A. fib was in the 100-120\nrange, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned above as well\nas 2u packed red blood cells. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR\nwith his rate responding 85-103. On review it appeared he\nrequired Amiodarone 150mg bolus and drip during prior episodes.\nAmiodarone was started on post-op day 1.

Differential\ndiagnosis includes seizure, syncope, infection, intracranial\nmass.  Description of episode, LOC without immediate recovery is\nmore consistent with seizure than syncope.  Pertinent negatives\ninclude normal CSF, CT scan unchanged without any acute bleed or\nmidline shift. Episode seems less likely to be syncope given\nassociation with headache, however she was placed on telemetry.\nNo events were found.  She had orthostatics which showed an\n18mmg difference between systolic blood pressures standing and\nsitting, and was given a fluid bolus of 1L.  EEG for 20 minute\nshowed short runs of sharp waves concerning for seizure\nactivity, and so 24-hour EEG was recommended.  Urine and blood\ncultures were sent. The 24 hour EEG study was undertaken and no\nseizure activity was noted.  Patient denied any seizure activity\nor loss of consciousness.  She was started on valproic Acid to\nprevent further seizures which she will take once discharged.\n\n(2) Headache:  Patient with 1-2 months of headaches that are\nincreasing in frequency and now associated with loss of\nconsciousness and vomiting.  Etiology unclear.  Differential\nincludes metastatic disease, migraine, tension, post LP,\nmedication side effect.  Patient has a history of migraine\nheadaches prior to diagnosis of breast cancer.  CT scan ruled\nout acute bleed or midline shift.  CSF with no evidence of\ninfection. She was started on morphine 2-5 mg q 4hrs prn pain\nwith continuation of gabapentin prn and cyclobenzaprine as\nneeded.  Pain service was consulted who recommended no blood\npatch as was considered a possibility as an outpatient.  They\ndid recommend IV caffeine, however, this is not available\ncurrently, as well as continuing morphine and encouraging good\nfluid intake, which minimalization of position changes.  Pt was\ntransitioned from Morphine IV to Morphine Sulfate IR 15-30 mg PO\nQ4H in preparation for discharge. This oral morphine seemed to\ncontrol her pain well and pt was satisfied with pain control\nregimen.\n\n(3) Leukocytosis:  Patient received neulasta [**8-8**]. Likely\nsecondary to this.  No evidence of infection (unchanged chest\nX-ray, normal CSF, normal urinalysis, denies fever, chills, or\nnightsweat).  Patient's oncologist informed who believes this is\nmost likely secondary to Neulasta and dexamethasone.  This was\ntrended.\n\n(4) Metastatic Breast Cancer:  Patient is s/p lumpectomy with\nchemo and radiation therapy.  Metastatic disease to lung, [**Month/Year (2) 500**],\nbrain, leptomeningeal disease.  Current chemo regimen includes\nintrathecal cytarabine, zoledronic acid, paclitaxel,\nbevacixumab.  Outpatient oncologist was informed.  Dexamethasone\ntaper from CyberKnife to cerebellar lesions was continued; this\nshould be 2mg [**2105-8-12**], 1mg [**2105-8-13**], 0.5mg [**2105-8-14**], then stop.\n Chemotherapeutic regimen was held while hospitalized which she\nwill resume as directed by primary oncologist.\n\n(5) CAD s/p MI with Stent:\n- continued ASA, crestor\n- Plavix on hold for possible blood patch, this was restarted as\nthe pain service does not want to pursue a blood patch.\n\n",

There is\nsubcutaneous emphysema tracking around the distal fifth\nmetatarsal along with adjacent soft tissue swelling. There is no\nperiosteal new bone formation or osseous destruction detected.\nNo acute fracture or dislocation is detected. There are hallux\nvalgus and metatarsus varus deformities with hyperostosis along\nthe medial aspect of the distal first metatarsal. Degenerative\nchanges are noted at the first MTP joint with joint space\nnarrowing and dorsal spurring. Large inferior and posterior\ncalcaneal spurs are also seen. There is a hammertoe deformity at\nthe second digit. Degenerative changes are seen in the mid foot\nat the talonavicular joint. An exaggerated arch is noted. There\nis patchy osteopenia. A linear radiopaque density is noted in\nthe subcutaneous tissue of the right heel which may represent a\nforeign body.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Radiographic findings suggestive of osteomyelitis at the head\nof the fifth metatarsal.\n2. Possible foreign body in the right heel.\n3. Hallux valgus. Hammertoe deformity of the second toe.\n\n[**10-23**] CXR:\nLow lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis but no findings to\nsuggest pneumonia.\n\n[**10-23**] Bone biopsy:\nPending\n\nconsult recommendations.  Her hemoglobin A1c\nwas found 12.6.  She was transferred to the general medical\nfloor on subcutaneous insulin and her blood sugars were\nprimarily well controlled.\n\n# Right foot osteomyelitis.\nThe patient presented with pus at the plantar surface of her\nright foot.  A deep tissue swab was taken, although after she\nhad already received antibiotics, and blood cultures were sent.\nA foot X ray suggested osteomyelitis at the head of the 5th\nmetatarsal and possible foreign body in the right heel.\nPodiatry was consulted and she was taken to the OR for\ndebridement and wash out with a bone biopsy twice.  She was\noriginally started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl.  The\ninfectious disease team was consulted who recommended that she\ntransition to ceftriaxone and flagyl as her cultures from the\nOSH and in house grew Group B strep and MSSA.  She will require\n6 weeks of ceftriaxone from the date of her last\ndebridement/wash out ([**Date range (1) 91603**]).  She was continued on flagyl\ndue to loose stools, please see below.\n\n# HTN.\nSBP was noted to be in the 170s upon arrival.  She was initially\ntreated with IV antihypertensives and transitioned to lisinopril\nin the MICU.  She continued to be hypertensive during the course\nof her stay.  The patient noted a cough a few days into her\ncourse of lisinopril and she was transitioned to valsartan and\nlater losartan for a generic antihypertensive.\n\n# Loose stools\nUpon arrival to the general medical floor, the patient began to\nreport loose stools.  Cdiff studies were sent and were negative.\n The patient continued to report loose stools, although reported\nthey were improving.  As the patient was being treated with\nflagyl, it was not entirely clear if this improvement was due to\nthe flagyl or resolving of her symptoms naturally.  A cdiff PCR\nof the stool was sent and she is to be continued on flagyl po\nuntil the results return.\n.\n# Substernal chest pressure\nAs part of her presentation, the patient reported occasionally\nsubsternal chest pressure.  She was ruled out for ACS, but was\nnoted to have EKG changes, most notably a LAFB.  While no former\nEKGs were within our system, this remained stable during her\nhospital course and her symptoms resolved and her condition\nimproved.\n\n# Medication noncompliance\nThe patient reported that she had not taken her insulin in three\nmonths as she had lost her insurance and was unable to afford\nmedications.  She met with both the case management and social\nwork teams who helped her procure insurance so she would be able\nto afford her medications in the future.\n\n# Health Insurance Coverage:  application for MassHealth was\ncompleted, and should hopefully be improved by the time of\ndischarge from rehab to cover home meds including insulin.\n\n============================================================\n============================================================\nTransitions of care:\n-Patient is to follow up with ID for both her duration of flagyl\nand ceftriaxone\n-She is to receive ceftriaxone 2 gm IV qday\n-Please monitor weeklylabs: CBC, Chem 7 (Na, K, Cl, HCO3, BUN,\nCr, glucose), LFTs, CRP, ESR\n-Hydrogel to dry daily dressing changes (wet to dry) to right\nfoot with ace wrapping.\n-Weight bearing as tolerated to right heel\n\nAll laboratory results should be faxed to Infectious disease\nR.Ns. at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1353**] All questions regarding outpatient\nantibiotics should be directed to the infectious disease R.Ns.\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital3 4339**]\n\nPrimary:\n-Diabetic ketoacidosis\n\nSecondary:\n-Right heel osteomyelitis\n-Hypertension\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane).\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nMs. [**Known lastname 174**],\n\nIt was a pleasure taking part in your care.

Family was notified of the\ncritical nature of her clinical state, and she was managed over\nthe next 24 hours with warming blankets, aggressive fluid\nresuscitation, correction of coagulopathy with blood products,\nand correction of her profound metabolic acidosis with sodium\nbicarbonate.  She was in multi organ system failure\npostoperatively and though she was initially hemodynamically\nstable, she ultimately required pressors to maintain a perfusing\nblood pressure and she was anuric.  A renal ultrasound\ndemonstrated no flow within the renal arteries, suggesting that\nthe kidneys had succumbed to the aneurysm prior to or during the\nsurgical repair.  Additionally she began to demonstrate signs of\nabdominal distention and DIC, and a general surgery consultation\nwas obtained to evaluate the need for exploratory laparotomy\ngiven the concern for bowel ischemia.  A family meeting was held\nand the possibilities for her care were discussed, including\nreturn to the operating room for abdominal exploration, CVVHD,\nnon-operative management, and comfort measures.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\n57 yo male with pmh of Hep C cirrhosis admitted for hepatic\nencephalopathy and hypotension now with resolved encephalopathy\nand stable pressures.\n\n# Previous episode of hypotension: Patient initally had a\nleukocytosis, hypothermia, and hypotension which was concerning\nfor spesis, however none of his blood cultures have been\npositive.  He had no evidence of GIB initially. His hematocrit\nfollowed as detailed below.  He may also have been dry from\noverdiuresis given recent increase in his diuretic dosing. He\nwas unable to have a diagnostic para due to the small amount of\nascites present. He was empirically treated for SBP with\nceftriaxone. His urine, blood, c.diff, CXR were negative.  He\nwas ultrasounded on multiple occasions but repeatedly with not\nenough fluid to safely tap for SBP evaluation.  He required\nvasopresssors for a little over 24 hours and was then able to be\nweaned.  Regarding antibiotics, he was initially placed on\nvancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl.  With above negative workup,\nhe was changed to ceftriaxone for SBP.  Also received 2 large\ndoses (1.5 mg/kg on day 1 and 1 mg/kg on day 3) of albumin given\npresumed SBP.  Stress dose steroids for 2 days given recent\nprednisone course.  He completed a 7 day course of ceftriaxone\nand was discharged on 250 mg of ciprofloxacin daily for SBP ppx.\n\n\n# Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped on hospital day 2 by 10\npoints in setting of aggressive hydration (his baseline is in\nthe 30s). His stools were trace guaiac positive. His Hct drop\nwas likely dilutional in addition to small amounts of bleeding\nin the setting of hepatic coaglatopathy (trace guiaic positive\nstools, epistaxis, phlebotomy).  He had a low haptoglobin and\nrising T. bili concerning for hemolysis; however these tests are\ndifficult to interpret in liver patients and his Hct remained\nstable after the inital drop.  On discharge his Hct was 27.2.\n\n# Positive UA/UCx: The patient had a positive UA on [**10-15**] (when\nhe was on ceftriaxone).  No antibiotics were added as he was\nalready on antibiotics.  The urine culture returned with MRSA.\nHowever the patient was asymptomatic, so another UA/UCx was sent\nand treatment was deferred.  The second UA was negative and the\nurine culture was negative.  It was thought that the inital\nurine culture was contaminated.\n\n# Acute renal failure:  The patient initally had ARF with a Cr\nof 1.6.  This improved to his baseline (of 0.8 to 1.0) with IVF\nand resolution of his hypotension.\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/? of HIT: The patient was noted to have a 50%\nplt drop over his admission.  His reported platlets at the OSH\nwere in the 70s to 90s and he was in the 40s here.  He had a plt\ntransfusion in the unit for epistaxis, but did not respond to\nthe transfusion.  DIC labs were stable.  Likely his\nthrombocytopenia was due to a combination of liver disease,\nconsumption, and possible splenomegaly.  Prior to his transfer\nout of the ICU his blood was sent for HIT Ab test which returned\npositive.  However, the team did no feel that he has HIT because\nhe had low probablity of HIT prior to the test being sent.  His\nplt ranged between 32 and 97 during this hospitalization and\nwere 58 at discharge.\n\n# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion improved with\nlactulose since his admission.  He had a history of decreased\nbowel movements prior to admission which is likely the\nprecipitant to his encephalopathy.  He was continued on\nlactulose with a goal of [**1-26**] bowel movements per day.\n\n# Hep C Cirrhosis: The patient not on the [**Date Range **] list and is\nundergoing workup currently. He is followed by Dr. [**Name (STitle) 23173**].\nHe had a history of grade III gastric varices s/p banding\nmultiple times (last in [**Month (only) **]).  After his BP stabilized he was\nrestarted on 40 mg of lasix and 100 mg of aldactone daily (he\nhad previously been increased to 80 mg of lasix and 200 mg of\naldactone).  He was also restarted on propanolol and continued\non a daily PPI.  He was continued on lactulose as above.  He had\nmany labs sent as requested for his workup for liver\ntransplantation.  He will follow up at the liver [**Month (only) **]\ncenter in [**Month (only) 1096**].\n\n# Asthma: The patient's asthma was stable.

Left ventricular\nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to\nmoderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. Quantitative\n(biplane) LVEF = 40 %. The left ventricle is heavity\ntrabeculated. The estimated cardiac index is normal\n(>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left\nventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left\nventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular\nchamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall\nhypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened\nbut aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets\nare mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild\n(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic\npericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with prominent\ntrabeculations and mild-moderate global hypokinesis. Mild mitral\nregurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\nIncreased PCWP.\nIn the absence of a history of myocardial infarction,\nnon-compaction would be included in the differential diagnosis.\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\nBased on [**2177**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended.

Cardiac enzymes were flat, and she\nhad no ischemic changes on her EKG. Following conversion to NSR\nshe was started on oral amiodarone and her pre-op betablocker,\nBetaxolol.  She subsequently maintained normal sinus rhythm.\n\nMrs. [**Known lastname 426**] had persistent leukocytosis with low grade fevers.\nShe had a pseudomonas UTI which was treated with Ceftazidime and\nthen underwent chest and abdominal CT which showed some patchy\nconsolidation in both apicies.  She underwent vigorous CPT and\nincentive spirometry and was maintained on antibiotics which was\neventually Cipro and Vancomycin.  A repeat urine culture on\n[**2140-5-30**] grew enterococcus and subsequently Linazolid was started\non [**2140-6-1**]\n\nHer surgical staples were removed on [**2140-5-30**], and she\nsubsequently had some wound dehiscence, mainly old blood.  The\nwound was cultured, and she had moist-to-dry dressing changes\n[**Hospital1 **] from that point on.  The cultue was positive for sparse\ngrowth of Pseudomonas, Beta strep and coag + staph. The wound\nbase remained clean, improved.\n\nFrom a GI standpoint, she was maintained on cyclic tube feeds\nand also had a speech and swallow evaluation for dysphagia,\nwhich did not reveal any dysphagia or aspiration. Due to ongoing\nepigastric discomfort, an Upper GI Barium Swallow without KUB\nwas performed on [**2140-6-2**], which revealed age-related diminished\nmotility changes, otherwise unremarkable.\n\nFollowing her diuresis early on, she remained euvolemic on Lasix\n20 mg PO BID with a creatinine of 0.9.\n\nDue to her prolonged hospitalization and deconditioning, she was\ndischarged to rehabiliation facility for continued physical\ntherapy with the hopes of returning home eventually.\n\n",

The specimen\nconsists of a distended gallbladder that measures 9 x 4.8 x 2.7\ncm. The cystic duct is identified and is probe patent. No cystic\nduct lymph node is identified. The gallbladder is opened and\ncontains approximately 25 mL of light green viscous bile in\naddition to numerous soft and fragmented gallstones of the mixed\ntype, which measure up to 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The mucosa of the\nspecimen is velvety and bile stained. The gallbladder wall\nmeasures up to 0.2 cm in thickness.  No discreet masses or\nlesions are noted. The specimen is represented in A.\n\nPart 2 is additionally labeled \"pancreatic head mass\". The\nspecimen consists of a pancreatico-duodenectomy specimen that\nmeasures 9.5 x 7 x 3 cm overall. The pancreatic portion is\ncomposed of a pancreatic head that measures 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm.\nThere is an attached portion of duodenum that measures 10 cm in\nlength, with an average diameter of 2.5 cm. The specimen is\noriented as follows: blue stitch = pancreatic duct, long silk =\nbile duct, long gree stitch = SMA margin. The pancreatic duct is\ndilated up to 0.5 cm, and it is not probe patent. The common\nbile duct is identified and is probe patent. The common bile\nduct is opened along its length to reveal unremarkable bile duct\nmucosa. The specimen is inked as follows: blue = pancreatic\nparenchymal margin, [**Location (un) 2452**] = uncinate process margin, yellow =\nposterior retroperitoneal margin. The duodenum is opened along\nthe anti pancreatic surface to reveal grossly unremarkable tan\nduodenal mucosa. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a\npoorly demarcated white firm area that measures 2.5 x 2.3 x 1.5\ncm. This area extends to within 1.0 cm of the posterior\nretroperitoneal yellow inked margin. It also grossly appears to\nextend to within 0.2 cm of the duodenal mucosa. The specimen is\nrepresented as follows: B = common bile duct margin, C =\npancreatic parenchymal margin, D = uncinate process margin, E =\nproximal duodenal margin, F = distal duodenal margin, G =\nampulla, H = duodenum, I-N = white firm area in relation to\nsurrounding structures, O = remainder of peripancreatic adipose\ntissue.\n\nPart 3 is additionally labeled jejunum. The specimen consists of\na segment of small bowel that measures 19 cm in length, with an\naverage diameter of 2.3 cm. The specimen is unoriented and both\nsmall bowel margins are closed with staple lines. The specimen\nis opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal\nunremarkable small intestinal tan mucosa.

His bleeding was stabilized with anterior\nand posterior packing. He was hemodynamically stable in the ICU.\nNo further bleeding once brought out to the floor.\n\n# Acute Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: Following extubation,\nthe patient had a prolonged (~2 days) period of delirium with\nmarked obtundation and episodes of significant agitation,\nrequiring chemical and physical restraints. His delirium was\nfelt secondary to either delayed clearance of his anesthetics vs\nfever. He was seen by psychiatry, who did not feel that the\ndelirium was due to venlafaxine withdrawal. He was placed on a\nprecedex infusion with subsequent clearing. He was awake, alert\nand interactive on [**7-31**], his day of transfer to the medical\nfloor. The patients mental status improved through discharge and\nwas at his baseline on [**8-2**].\n\n# Fever likely from Aspiration PNA/Pneumonitis: The patient had\nfevers around the time of his extubation, and was started on\nbroad spectrum antibiotics to treat HCAP, due to his high\naspiration risk and small lower lobe opacities on chest x-ray.\nThe pt was treated empirically with Vanc/Zosyn for 4 days and\nwas transitioned to Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **]. This was continued for a\nplanned 13 more days to cover both MRSA aspiration PNA (per\nSputum Cx on [**7-28**]) and for MRSA Chronic Sinusitis.\n\n# Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: History of grade [**2-21**] varices on beta\nblockade. Wife unsure if patient currently taking peg\ninterferon, ribavirin, and boceprevir for hepatitis C treatment.\n NPO without feeding tube, so will hold on nadolol and\neplerenone in the setting of bleeding.  He had a likely --\ntachycardia, and nadolol was resumed on the day of transfer from\nthe MICU.\n\n# Depression: His venlafaxine was held while NPO, but was\nrestarted during admission.\n\n# Diabetes: His metformin was held while inpatient.

His CT guided sinus surgery was\ncomplete when the surgeons noticed oozing at diffuse mucosal\nsurfaces which did not appear to be from any specific vessels.\nThey placed packing in the anterior nares with some resolution\nof his bleeding. He was about to be woken up and extubated, when\nthere was an accidental extubation while the patient was still\nunder sedation. An airway emergency was called. His oral cavity\nwas suctioned with continued oozing noticed in the oropharynx.\nThere was concern for aspiration. It took multiple attempts but\nhe was successfully reintubated. Blood was noted in the ETT.\nOnce more alert, he was extubated, and was doing well satting\n99% on shovel mask. However, he had continued oozing at the\nfront of his packing, PACU. He was given a unit of platelet with\nbetter control of his bleeding for the next hour. CXR was clear\nand EKG was normal. He was hemodynamically stable during this\ntime with PACU vitals of 143/76 71 19 98% RA. Labs revealed an\nINR of 1.4 so he was given 1 unit of FFP. In the PACU, the\npatient noted intermittent dizzy spells while sitting up so he\nwas given 1 unit of pRBC's. In addition, he received 1700cc\ncrystalloid, with 400cc of UOP. He denied CP, SOB, palpitations,\nnausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain at that time.\n.\nENT came to reevaluate the patient and brought him back to the\nOR to look for the site of bleeding. He underwent bilateral\nsinus exploration which did not identify source of bleeding, but\nrather only oozing from his nasal mucosa. Anterior and posterior\npacking with foley catheters was performed. The catheters were\ninserted, balloon inflated, and then pulled forward with\ntension. His anterior nasal cavity was packed with anterioform\ngauze that was covered with vaseline. Clamps were placed to hold\nthe foleys in place. During the procedure, he was noted to have\nhigh pip's, and was subsequently given an extra large dose of a\nparalytic [**Doctor Last Name 360**]. As a result, he was kept intubated overnight,\nwith a plan to extubate in the morning.\n.\nOn the floor, patient was intubated and sedated.\n.\nReview of systems: Unable to report while sedated.\n\n",

She later dropped her pressure to 75/doppler was\nasymptomatic at the time.  She was bolused 2L and not fluid\nresponsive.  Her pressures hovered in the 80s/doppler.  She was\nmentating well and her urine output was good, but given she\ncontinued to not be fluid responsive she was transferred to the\nMICU for further care.\n.\nIn the MICU, the patient had a CVL and arterial line placed and\nreceived levophed for hypotension.  Hypotension was likely\nsecondary to Still's flare, as patient had hypotension with\nprior flares, however, given her HIV and immunocompromised\nstate, infectious etiology was considered.  Patient received\nsolumedrol 1000 mg IV daily for three days as per rheumatology\nrecommendation.  On the last day of admission patient was\ntransitioned to prednisone 60 mg daily with planned long taper.\nAnakinra was continued.

All\ninfectious work up returned negative.  She completed a course of\ncefepime and vancomycin.  Her symptoms improved.  Her labs were\nfollowed and they were all improving steadily.  She was seen by\nphysical therapy and they initially recommended Rehab, but she\ndid not want to go and the family felt they had a strong network\nof support that could care for her on a 24 hour basis.  This was\ndiscussed with the patient and she was re-evaluated by physical\ntherapy who felt she could go home with PT as opposed to Rehab.\nShe was discharged on anakinra and prednisone 60mg PO Daily and\nfollow up with rheumatology and ID for further management of her\nchronic issues.\n.\n# SOB: patient is vague regarding her sx of SOB, no\ndesaturations.

Patient was\nsucessfully extubated, but still tachypnic ?????? may be [**2-11**]\nmetabolic acidosis (respiratory compensation).  Her tachypnea\nslowly resolved althought there was no known cause.\n.\n# Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely [**2-11**] RTA due to HAART\nor less likely autoimmune disease. Patient received IVF with\nbicarb. Renal consulted and felt that patient likely had\nfanconi's syndrome [**2-11**] to tenofovir.  Her potassiume and\nphosphate were aggressively repleted.

She was finally stabilized on potassium\nchloride 40mEq PO Daily and neutra-phos 2 packets PO TID.  She\nwill be followed by Renal, ID and Rheumatology and her\nelectrolyte supplementation will be adjusted as her RTA\nresolves.\n.\n# Pancytopenia:  Unclear as to whether this was a true diagnosis\nof [**Doctor First Name **] syndrome or whether there was some other process\ndriving this process.  It was felt to be auto-immune in nature\nas described above and she received 2 days of IVIg therapy prior\nto discharge.  She tolerated this treatment well and her counts\nbegan to rise at the time she was sent home.  She will be follow\nup in the outpatient setting for this issue.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nSummary:  58 yo F presenting with hyperbilirubinemia, renal\nfailure, leukocytosis and anemia, diagnosed with new liver\nfailure in setting of alocholic hepatitis.\n.\n# Hyperbilirubinemia, ascites, edema, liver failure: The patient\nhad known risk factors for EtOH hepatitis, and her previous\nelevation in LFTs was in the context of admitted EtOH use.\nHowever, given the lack of previous history, other causes were\ninvestigated.  Infectious hepatitis and AIH labs were negative.\nShe was treated with albumin. EGD revealed 4 cords of Grade 2\nvarices.  Started nadolol [**1-7**], but d/c [**1-8**] for\nbronchoconstriction.  Propranolol was then started on [**1-19**].  Her\nMELD score reduced to 16.  Diruesis was started to reduce\nascites and peripheral edema.  Dobhoff feeding tube placed [**1-21**]\nfor tube feeding given poor nutritional status.  This came out\non [**1-23**] and was replaced after the patient could not maintain\ncaloric intake.  Tube feeds continued at goal at the time of\ndischarge.\n.\n# Kidney injury:  Cr elevated at 2.2 on admission, last value\n0.8 in [**2099**].  Renal ultrasound no evidence of obstruction or\nhydronephrosis.  Repeat urine lytes showed that she was\npre-renal with UNa < 10, FeNa 0.08%.  HRS was considered and\ntreatment with albumin, octreotide and midodrine was initiated.\nA course of 5 days treatment did not improve renal function and\nthese treatments were therefore discontinued.  Creatinine\nimproved at the time of discharge to a stable value of ~1\n.\n# Leukocytosis:  The patient had leukocytosis that persisted\nthroughout admission.  She was treated for a UTI/pneumonia, but\nother infectious work-up was negative\n.\n# UTI:  Urine culture positive for E coli, treated with Cipro\nfor 3 days.  Later urine cultures negative.\n.\n# Anemia and duodenal ulcer: Patient presented with anemia (Hct\n24.1), required 3 units PRBCs to maintain Hct.  She was guaiac\nnegative.  EGD found duodenal ulcer that was cauterized.    Her\nulcer was treated with PPI.\n.\n# Respiratory distress and MICU course:  On the night of [**1-9**],\nthe patient spiked a temperature to 101 and developed a new\noxygen requirement.  She was started on vanc/zosyn for hospital\nacquired pneumonia but continued to be tachypnic.  In the early\nmorning of [**1-10**], patient became acutely hypoxic with crackles\nthroughout her lung fields.  A CXR was consistent with flash\npulmonary edema.  She was treated with IV diuresis and was\ntransferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.\nEchocardiography was consistent with volume overload, but there\nwas no clear precipitant for flash pulmonary edema.  The patient\nrecovered rapidly with diuresis and was transferred back to the\nfloor on [**1-11**].  The cardiology team was consulted and\nrecommended outpatient follow-up to ensure resolution of right\nventricular distension with appropriate diuresis.\n\n# Depression / ETOh abuse:  Per family, the patient has been\nstruggling with depression for the last 2 years, which has been\nthe main driver for her EtOH abuse.  The patient denied HI/SI.\nSocial work was involved for help with placement and outpatient\nservices. Continued vitamin supplementation.\n.\n# Mania:  Patient had visual hallucination [**1-12**] overnight.\n[**Date range (1) 25386**] she became more manic, was not sleeping, and exhibited\npressured speech and disorganized thoughts.  Psychiatry\nconsultation was obtained.  She was diagnosed with a mania NOS\nand was treated with Haldol.  Other medications were not started\nin the context of liver failure.  She was initially subject to\nSection 12 for 3 days, however this was discontinued as her\nmental status normalized with treatment.  This will need\noutpatient follow-up. She needs intensive outpatient\npsychotherapy (potentially dual diagnosis facility) upon leaving\nLTAC.\n.\n# Hyponatremia:  131 on presentation, normalized on hydration.\nDropped again with initiation of tube feeding, rose with fluid\nrestriction at 1.5 L.\n.\n# Right shoulder dislocation:  Appeared to be Grade III superior\ndislocation of right clavicle.  The patient reported that this\nis secondary to a fall in [**2103-1-30**] and that she did not\nseek treatment.  She had good mobility and strength in the arm.\nPer Up-to-Date, treatment for Grade III dislocations is\nconservative, and at as her function was good there was no\nindication for orthopedic intervention.\n# HTN:  Discontinued home atenolol, pressures well controlled.\n# Hyperlipidemia:  found to have dyslipidemia with low HDL and\nelevated LDL.  Treatment deferred to outpatient follow-up\n# Hyperglycemia:  Brief period of hyperglycemia on admission,\nrapidly resolved.  ISS used for the first two days of admission.\n# Insomnia:  Discontinued home Ambien and Ativan, used trazodone\nPRN\n.\n# CODE: Full\n# CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **], son [**Name (NI) 916**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60942**]\n=====================================================\nTransitional Issues:\n- Treatment of dyslipidemia\n- Psychiatric follow-up for substance abuse, mania\n- Consider transplant listing once patient has achieved 3 months\nsobriety\n- Cardiology follow-up to ensure resolution of right heart\nvolume overload\n- Per Psychiatry:  In outpatient setting, could consider the\nfollowing non-urgent\nrecommendations.  1) Neuropsychological testing to determine\nwhether or not there may be longterm cognitive deficits\nassociated with ETOH abuse 2) consider cross-tapering Haldol to\nanother medication with more mood-stabilizing properties (e.g.\nquetiapine)\n- Trend WBC for persistent leukocytosis.\n- Trend HCT, transfusions for symptomatic anemia\n- Check EKG once a week to eval QTc while on haldol\n- Encourage PO intake, regular nutritional assessments while on\ntube feeds\n- Assess when able to change psychiatric meds based on LFTs\n- Trend LFTs, chemistry, CBC daily until sees liver in\noutpatient followup\n\n",

No definite focal hepatic\nlesion is seen. The gallbladder wall appears mildly thickened,\nlikely due to underlying liver disease. No gallstones are noted.\nThe common bile duct is normal in caliber, measuring 0.5 cm, and\nthere is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The\nmain portal vein is patent but shows reversed hepatofugal flow.\nThe spleen measures 13 cm which is mildly enlarged. The\nvisualized portions of the pancreas are unremarkable. There is\nmoderate to large amount of ascites, particularly in the right\nlower quadrant.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Cirrhosis with hepatofugal flow within the main portal vein.\nModerate to large amount of ascites and mild splenomegaly.\n2. Mild gallbladder wall thickening that is likely due to\nunderlying liver disease.\n3. No biliary dilatation.\n.\nCXR ([**1-1**]):\nIMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without radiographic evidence for\nacute\ncardiopulmonary process.\n.\nRenal ultrasound ([**1-3**]):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No hydronephrosis, and no renal stones identified.\n2. Moderate ascites.\n.\nEGD ([**1-7**]):\nIMPRESSION: No DVT in the right lower extremity.\n.\n[**1-23**] NG tube placement by IR:\n  PROCEDURE ANDIMPRESSION:\nFluoroscopic placement of an 8 French nasointestinal tube.

Given history of\nfrequent\nepistaxis, the continued use of a bridle should be reviewed by\nthe primary\nteam.\n.\nDischarge labs;\n\n[**2104-1-31**] 05:35AM BLOOD WBC-7.8 RBC-2.35* Hgb-8.4* Hct-25.0*\nMCV-107* MCH-35.9* MCHC-33.7 RDW-18.6* Plt Ct-271\n[**2104-1-31**] 05:35AM BLOOD PT-15.2* PTT-32.0 INR(PT)-1.4*\n[**2104-1-31**] 05:35AM BLOOD Glucose-133* UreaN-29* Creat-1.1 Na-131*\nK-4.6 Cl-100 HCO3-21* AnGap-15\n[**2104-1-31**] 05:35AM BLOOD ALT-30 AST-67* AlkPhos-120* TotBili-3.8*\n[**2104-1-31**] 05:35AM BLOOD Calcium-9.9 Phos-3.7 Mg-1.6\n\nFINDINGS: Lung volumes are low. No focal consolidation, pleural\neffusion, or pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is top normal.\nLinear opacity projecting over the right middle lobe likely\nrepresents atelectasis.\nFINDINGS: Note is made that this is a limited study due to the\npatient's body habitus. The right kidney measures 10.4 cm, and\nthe left kidney measures 11.3 cm. There is no hydronephrosis,\nand no renal stones are identified. No cyst or solid mass is\nseen in either kidney. There is a moderate amount of ascites\nwithin the abdomen.\nFINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of right common\nfemoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, popliteal and\nproximal calf veins were performed. There is normal\ncompressibility, flow and augmentation throughout.\nFINDINGS:\nThe patient was placed supine on the imaging table. After\nadministration of Lido-Gel, an 8 French [**Location (un) 2174**]-[**Doctor First Name 1557**] tube,\nstiffened with the [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire, was passed through right\nnostril into the third part of the duodenum.  Injection of\ncontrast demonstrated the post-pyloric location. The [**Last Name (un) 7648**]\nwire was removed and the catheter was flushed with water. The\ntube was then secured with a bridle.\n  The patient experienced epistaxis from the left nostril\nbriefly at the beginning of the procedure, which she stated is\nnot unusual for her. After placement of the bridle, however, she\nbegan to again have epistaxis again, which continued for\napproximately 10 minutes.\nImpression:\n- Varices at the lower third of the esophagus\n- Mild portal gastropathy, old residual in the stomach\n- Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum\n- Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum\nRecommendations:\n- follow up with liver center and PCP.\n[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] She should be on a PPI and beta Blockers for prevention of\nvariceal bleeding.\n.\nCXR ([**1-9**]):\nMild cardiomegaly is stable. New multifocal lung opacities right\ngrater than left are consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema,\nmultifocal pneumonia cannot be totally excluded. Follow up after\ndiuresis is recommended. There is no evident pneumothorax or\npleural effusion.\n.\nCXR ([**1-10**]):\nCardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung volumes. Small\nbilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right are new. Difuse\nlung consolidations, larger on the right lung have progressed.\nThese are more consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.\ninfectious process remains possible. Follow up is recommended.\n.\nECHO ([**1-10**]):\nNormal left ventricular cavity size with mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy and preserved global left ventricular\nsystolic function. Dilated right ventricle consistent with\npossible volume overload. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to\nmoderate mitral regurgitation. Mild to moderate tricuspid\nregurgitation.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\n# Respiratory failure: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was\nfebrile, in respiratory distress, tachypnic and hypoxic. On her\nprior hospitalization, her code status had been changed to\nDNR/DNI by her HCP Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. However, in the ED, the\nnursing home paper work indicated her to be full code; the ED\ncalled her HCP who asked her to be intubated. The patient was\nfiberoptically nasally intubated given her severe kyphosis. The\netiology of her respiratory distress was somewhat unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 227**]\nher prior aspiration pneumonia's, it was first assumed that she\nhad a recurrent aspiration PNA. She was initially placed on\nVanc, Meropenem (given ESBL- Ecoli on admission 10 days\nprior)and Levofloxacin empirically prior to culture data for ?\nHAP vs aspiration PNA. However, her CXR remained unchanged - ?\nopacification vs atelectasis at the left base-, she had minimal\nsputum production and her lungs only had upper airway rhonchi. A\nsmall amount of sputum did grown sparse GNR 2-3 days into\nextubation - which may be colonization. Ultimately it was\nthought that SIRS and bacteremia may have caused tachypnea and\nrespiratory distress rather than a primary lung process. She was\neasily extubated on HD #4 and maintained good oxygenation on\nnasal canula.\n.\n# Bacteremia: The patient's blood grew 4/4 bottles of\nenterococcus and Ecoli within hours of admission. She was\ninitially placed on Vanc, Meropenem and Levofloxacin empirically\nprior to culture data for ? HAP vs aspiration PNA. Her blood\ncultures then grew Ecoli resistant flouroquinolones, but\nsensitive to most other abx including Meropenem. The\nenterococcus was pan-sensitive. And ultimately her antibiotic\nregimen was weaned down to Meropenem. Meropenem was chosen as\nher Urine grew MDR Ecoli sensitive to Meropenem, gent and Zosyn\nas as she had had ESBL Ecoli in the past. Surveillance blood\ncultures were all negative. The source of her bacteremia was\ndebated. Given the poly-microbial nature, it was thought that\nher PICC vs decubitous ulcer/ ?possible osteomyelitis were the\nmost likely etiologies. Although he decub was to bone, the ulcer\nitself looked well healed and not infected. Furthermore, plastic\nsurgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt that she was not a surgical\ncandidate for surgical repair/flap. The ID service was consulted\nwho felt that she should have a 2 week course of meropenam.\nGiven that she cleared her blood cultures, no murmur on exam,\nthere was low suspicion for endocarditis.\n.\n# UTI: UA positive, Ucx with Ecoli sensitive only to Meropenem,\nGent and Zosyn. Her Foley was changed. She was treated with\nMeropenem.\n.\n# There was difficulty administering medications through her\nG-tube. Her G-tube was replaced by IR.\n.\n# CODE status: DNR/DNI after discussion with her HCP Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The patient has been intubated several times now and it\nwas recommended that she have a trachostomy placed if she failed\nextubation and required re-intubation. Her HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] did\nnot want a trach placed. In addition, the harm of CPR to this\nfrail kpyphotic elderly woman was explained. Ultimately, her HCP\ndecided against CPR, resucitation or re-intubation.\n\nThis has been an ongoing discussion with the family. Included\nare past dicussions between medical team and family. At\ndischarge, there was discussion regarding long term goals and\nwhether patient would benefit from meeting with hospice care. It\nwas the medical teams opinion that patient would benefit from\nfurther hospice discussions and would not be well served by\nfrequent repeat hospital admissions. Social work is well\naquainted with the patient and family and will follow-up as an\noutpatient.\nDate: [**2106-5-25**]\nSigned by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**], MD on [**2106-5-25**] at 11:25 am  Affiliation:\n[**Hospital1 18**]\n\nI spoke with Ms. [**Known lastname 98902**] [**Known lastname 802**]/HCP [**Name (NI) **] this morning.  We have\ndecided to extubate the pt.  She tends to have a rapid shallow\nbreathing pattern at her baseline.  Yesterday she was on 5/0 for\n2 hours, and her ABG after 2 hours was 7.51/48/118, suggesting\nthat she does not decompensate from this breathing pattern.\nIt's\nlikely due to her severe kyphoscoliosis and inability to take a\ndeep breath from a restrictive chest wall.  Therefore, despite\nan\nelevated RSBI, I think it's appropriate to extubate her at this\ntime.\n\nI spoke with [**Doctor First Name **] about what we will do if she fails\nextubation.\nI explained that if she fails and has recurrent respiratory\nfailure, she will require a tracheostomy (given her intubation\nfor >2 weeks).  [**Doctor First Name **] and her brother feel that the pt would not\nwant a trach.  Therefore, if she fails extubation, we will keep\nher comfortable but will not reintubate her, knowing that she\nwill likely die from this.  [**Doctor First Name **] and her brother are in\nagreement with this plan.\nDate: [**2106-6-4**]\nSigned by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 98909**], MD on [**2106-6-4**] at 5:56 pm  Affiliation:\n[**Hospital1 18**]\nNEEDS COSIGN\n\nCalled neice Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1445**] regarding her aunt [**Name (NI) 4134**].  I\nupdated her on the blood infection, PICC line and replacement of\nher G tube.  I also addressed her intubation and that she meets\ncriteria for extubation.  However, her underlying scoliosis and\npoor respiratory reserve makes the chance of failure very high.\nGiven that this would be the third time she would be intubated\nif\nshe failed we would recommend a tracheostomy.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1445**] spoke\nwith her brother and they are both in agreement that she would\nnot want a tracheostomy.  In addition, it was decided that they\nwould not want her to undergo CPR in the event of a cardiac\narrest.\n\nWe will perform a repeat SBT in the am and if she passes will\nproceed with extubation with the understanding that if she fails\nshe will be transitioned to comfort focused care.\n\nWe will call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1445**] prior to extubation if she passes her\nSBT\ntomorrow.\n\n[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD\n\n\n",
