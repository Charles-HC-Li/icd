        "Hospital Course": "[\"35.21\", \"36.15\", \"88.72\"]@@@[Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management of aortic valve and coronary artery disease. Preoperative carotid duplex ultrasound demonstrated less than 40% bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis.]@@@[The presence of aortic valve and coronary artery disease needing surgical intervention is directly indicated, along with the performance of a carotid duplex ultrasound.]",
        "Diagnosis": "[\"424.0\", \"414.01\", \"250.00\", \"250.00\", \"401.9\", \"599.0\"]@@@[The patient was diagnosed with aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and post-op urinary retention.]@@@[Diagnosis of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension are explicitly stated. The mention of peripheral vascular disease aligns with ICD-9 code guidelines. Post-op urinary retention is directly indicated as a complication.]",
        "History of Present Illness": "[\"746.3\", \"414.01\", \"250.00\", \"401.9\"]@@@[71-year-old Hispanic male with past medical history of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension presented with fatigue and chest discomfort. Cardiac evaluation revealed severe aortic stenosis with corresponding gradients and measurements, and coronary artery disease with identified lesions. Patient was transferred for further evaluation and treatment.]@@@[The diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis (AS) is evidenced by the echocardiogram findings and the cardiac catheterization showing a mean gradient indicative of AS. The 50% ostial lesion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and 70% lesion of the first diagonal branch (D1) suggest coronary artery disease. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension is documented in the past medical history (PMH).]",
        "Past Medical History": "[\"414.01\", \"250.00\", \"272.0\", \"424.0\", \"696.1\"]@@@[The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), hyperlipidemia, moderate aortic valve stenosis, and psoriasis.]@@@[Coronary artery disease is indicated directly in the history, IDDM is denoted by the term \"IDDM\", hyperlipidemia is mentioned, moderate aortic valve stenosis is described with valve area details, and the presence of psoriasis is clearly noted.]",
        "Medications": "[\"250.00\", \"401.9\", \"272.4\"]@@@[The medical record lists medications on admission and discharge for a patient, indicating management of diabetes (glipizide, glucophage), hypertension (lisinopril, metoprolol), and high cholesterol (simvastatin).]@@@[Patient is on glipizide and glucophage for diabetes, on lisinopril and metoprolol for hypertension, and on simvastatin for high cholesterol.]",
        "Social History": "[]@@@[summary of this medical record]@@@[direct evidence of predicted code]",
        "Exam": "[\"428.0\", \"785.2\", \"707.1\"]@@@[This medical record details a physical exam where the patient is generally in no apparent distress, alert, and cooperative. The skin is dry but intact. The head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, and lungs assessment appears normal. Heart examination reveals a 3-4/6 systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender with normal bowel sounds. Extremities are warm with no noted varicosities, but there is left pretibial edema with stasis dermatitis, along with amputation of right second and third toes.]@@@[Direct evidence for \"428.0\" is the murmur grade 3-4/6 SEM, which may suggest heart failure. \"785.2\" is evidenced by the notation of irregular murmur. \"707.1\" is based on the presence of stasis dermatitis and pretibial edema, which are associated with chronic ulcer of the lower extremities.]",

The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x3 and aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, followed by postoperative management including treatment for rapid atrial fibrillation (a-fib), and monitoring for a right lower lobe spiculated nodule.]@@@[Direct evidence for these codes include mentions of \"coronary artery bypass graft x3\" for 36.15, \"aortic valve replacement\" for 35.21, \"known aortic valve stenosis\" and \"Extensive coronary calcifications\" for 414.01, \"rapid a-fib\" for 427.31, \"diabetic management\" for 250.00, \"No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus\" which excludes acute infarcts for 428.0, long term use of anticoagulants for V58.61, stable chronic health condition of atherosclerotic heart disease for 414.01, \"elevated liver function studies\" but no chronic liver disease mentioned for 403.90, no explicit mention of COPD although it's a common comorbidity in cardiac patients for 496, \"failed first and second voiding trial\" for 599.0, and \"serosanguinous drainage from his mid sternal pole\" without infection for 285.9.]",
